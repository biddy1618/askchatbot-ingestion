       "      'body': {'description': 'Two species of skunk are found in California, the spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis) and the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), which is the species most commonly found around homes. Although originally considered members of the weasel family, recent genetic research has placed skunks into their own family Mephitidae. Both skunk species produce an oily, yellow sulfur-alcohol compound that contains sulfuric acid. This pungent liquid is stored in two separate scent glands located on each side of the anus and can be squirted accurately at targets as far as 6 to 10 feet away as a self-defense mechanism. The secretion is acrid enough to cause nausea and can produce severe burning and temporary blindness if it strikes the eyes.',\n",

       "       'development': 'Skunks have a triangular-shaped head and a moderately elongated body with short, muscular legs and long, sharp non-retractable claws. The striped skunk is about the size of an adult house cat, and its fur is mostly black with white on top of the head and neck. In most animals the white extends down the back, usually separating into two white stripes. Spotted skunks are black with white spots or short white streaks. They are smaller than the striped skunk, about half the size of a house cat. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Striped skunks are primarily active at dawn, dusk, and at night but can be active during the daytime, particularly in human-use areas. Spotted skunks rarely venture out during the daytime. Both skunk species consume a highly-varied diet including insects, grubs, earthworms, small rodents, snakes, lizards, frogs, mushrooms, berries and fruit, pet food, and garbage. Skunks will also opportunistically feed on bird eggs, which can result in substantial losses to ground-nesting birds when skunk densities are high. Food items found in their diet will vary seasonally depending on availability. Breeding usually occurs during February and March for the striped skunk; gestation time is about 9 weeks and litters range from 4 to 6 kits. After 2 to 3 months, the kits can be seen following their mother as she makes her nightly rounds in search of food. Skunks are capable of breeding the spring following birth. The average life span of skunks is around 2 to 3.5 years, although they can occasionally live up to 7 years in the wild. Skunks often den in burrows. They will often use abandoned burrows dug by ground squirrels, foxes, or coyotes and will enlarge them if necessary. If dens are scarce, they will readily use brush piles, hollow logs, and culverts. In urban settings, they den under decks, porches, or beneath buildings. If other suitable dens are unavailable, skunks will dig their own dens. Skunks do not hibernate; but in regions with colder weather, they may congregate in communal dens during the winter. Skunks are attracted to residential areas by the availability of food, water, and shelter. They become a nuisance when they live under porches, decks, garden tool sheds, or homes. Their scent is usually not welcome around homes, and they often spray dogs that bark and approach rapidly. They like to feed on ripening berries and fallen fruit and cause other garden problems by digging while in search of grubs and other insects. They often search for food in lawns by digging small pits or cone-shaped depressions that range from 3 to 5 inches across. Like raccoons, they may also damage lawns by rolling back sections of sod in search of insects. Skunks have an excellent sense of smell and good hearing, but they have very poor vision. This poor vision explains why they are often hit by cars when crossing roads. A skunk may not react if a person more than 10 feet away is quiet and standing still or moving slowly. Healthy skunks are mild-tempered animals. They are not aggressive and, given the opportunity, prefer to flee rather than fight. They usually only defend themselves when suddenly frightened, cornered, or harmed. Skunks usually provide a warning before discharging their scent by stamping their forefeet rapidly, hissing, and arching their tail over their back. Skunks prefer not to spray given the time required to replenish their spray supply. Therefore, using caution around skunks should substantially reduce the possibility of being sprayed. Disease concerns occur when skunks take up residence in an urban or suburban setting. In California, skunks are one of the most common carriers of rabies, a viral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected animal. Skunks can also be carriers of other diseases including leptospirosis, listeriosis, canine distemper, canine hepatitis, Q-fever, and tularemia. LEGAL STATUS The California Fish and Game Code classifies skunks as nongame mammals. The owner or tenant of the premises may lethally remove nongame mammals that are injuring or threatening at any time and in any legal manner. Fish and Game regulations prohibit the relocation of skunks and other wildlife without written permission of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The prevalence of rabies in the skunk population is one of several major reasons for denying requests for relocation. For further information on the legal status of skunks, contact the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.',\n",
       "       'damage': '',\n",
       "       'management': 'Because rabies is endemic in the skunk population, some city or county health departments assist in the control of skunks by providing trappers to remove them from residential areas. Some private pest control companies will also trap and remove skunks for a fee. The skunks tendency to spray their musk-laden spray is sufficient to make them unwelcome visitors, especially in close proximity to homes. However, removing a skunk from a property may not offer a permanent solution if nothing is done to deter other skunks from the property. Several actions can be taken to make gardens, yards, and residences less attractive to skunks. Because they are usually active only at low-light hours and at night, many people never see skunks as they travel through neighborhoods or yards. Barking dogs may be the first apparent sign of their presence, and the odor resulting from a skunk/dog confrontation will provide positive evidence. If skunks repeatedly travel through your yard or garden, sooner or later you will detect a faint skunk odor, even if the skunk has not sprayed. As with raccoons, an occasional visit by a skunk or a family of skunks may not be cause for concern; but if these visits become commonplace, some action is probably warranted. During the breeding season, males frequently spray when fighting over females. The presence of these odors in late winter is a signal that skunks might be nearby and that it could be necessary to take appropriate measures to prevent pregnant females from accessing potential nesting sites underneath buildings and other structures. Habitat Modification The most effective way to make your property less attractive to skunks is by reducing access to food, water, and shelter that the animals need. To reduce food sources, fallen fruit and spilled seed from bird feeders should be removed frequently. Garbage cans should have tight-fitting lids, and food items or table scraps should not be placed in compost bins; use hot rather than cold compost method to process organic waste. Food placed outdoors for pets should be removed by nightfall. Intentionally feeding a wild skunk, even when done with good intentions, is a harmful practice. The skunk or its young may become dependent on the unnatural food source and lose their fear of people. This increases the chance that an adult or child may be bitten. Also, the skunk may be trapped or killed when it wanders into another yard where it is not welcome. It is also suggested that the management of grubs and other insects in lawns can reduce food for skunks. In theory, this will deter the animal from further digging. If your lawn is infested with insects or grubs, see Pest Notes: Lawn Insects or contact your local University of California Cooperative Extension office. Potential den sites can be limited by cutting back overgrown shrubbery and by stacking firewood tightly, preferably at least 18 inches above the ground. Remove boards, rocks, and debris lying on the ground, as insects that skunks feed on hide under these objects. Also, control mice and rats so that their numbers do not build up and provide an abundant food source for skunks. Exclusion As with many other vertebrate pests, the best solution for skunk problems beneath porches or buildings is to screen or block them out. Close off all potential entrances or openings under houses, garden tool sheds, mobile homes, porches, and decks with 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth. The advantage of using the small mesh is that it will also exclude rats and house mice if installed correctly. Skunks will work hard to get into a desirable denning space, so take care to make fittings good and tight. If there is soil underneath the potential entrances, bury the wire at least 6 inches to discourage skunks from digging under. Once skunks have made their home beneath a building, the problem is a little more difficult because you have to be sure the animals have left before blocking the opening. One way to determine this is to sprinkle a smooth, 1/8-inch thick layer of flour just in front of the point of entrance to form a tracking patch. Examine the tracking patch soon after dark; the presence of footprints will indicate that the animal has left and the opening can be closed. However, blocking the entrance is more problematic if there are several young left behind. If you are not sure that all the skunks beneath a building have left, a one-way, outward-swinging gate can be fashioned that will allow any remaining skunks to leave but not to re-enter. This gate can be constructed from 1/2-inch mesh hardware cloth hinged at the top of the frame and left loose on the other three sides. It must be larger than the opening so that it can only swing outward. Skunks will push it open to leave but will not be able to push it inward to re-enter. This is ineffective, of course, if the kits are not yet mobile; kits not yet able to walk may have to be removed by other means. The placement of one or more floodlights beneath the building facing outward through the skunks entry point will often assist in driving them away from a location. Trapping Skunks can be caught with an enclosed cage-type, live-catch trap. Plastic box traps are superior to wire traps because they are completely enclosed, thus reducing the risk of getting sprayed while removing the trapped animal from the site. If a wire live trap is used, cover the back end with an old blanket when setting the trap. The blanket serves two purposes. First, it provides shelter for the skunk. Secondly, it allows the trapper to slowly cover the entire trap once the skunk is captured. Skunks are less stressed when in dark environments and thus are less likely to spray. Be careful when placing the blanket on the back end of the trap so that it does not interfere with the trigger mechanism. Once the trap has been completely covered with the blanket, the trap can be relocated to a carbon dioxide gas chamber for euthanasia. If in a remote area, shooting can also be used to euthanize the trapped skunk. However, skunks usually spray when shot, so shooting may not be the best approach. Note that drowning is not an acceptable or legal form of euthanasia. Once euthanized, skunks can be double-bagged and disposed of in the garbage. Traps can be baited with a variety of foods including sardines, canned cat food, tuna, or bacon. Sweeter foods also work (e.g., peanut butter, apples, melon rinds, marshmallows, doughnuts, etc.) and may be less likely to capture cats. Individuals who have no experience trapping skunks should hire a professional wildlife control operator. Professionals have the experience and all the necessary equipment to trap and dispatch the animal. An experienced trapper is also much less apt to be sprayed, an event to be avoided if at all possible. Skunks cannot be relocated without a permit, and because of the potential for rabies it is unlikely the California Department of Fish and Wildlife will issue one. Other Control Methods Burrow fumigants such as gas or smoke cartridges may be used in rural areas if the burrows used by skunks can be located and are not under or near buildings. They are not generally recommended for use in residential areas because of the risk of fire and penetration of the gas into buildings. These cartridges are ignited and pushed into the skunks burrow. The burrow is then sealed off with soil and packed tightly to prevent the toxic and asphyxiating smoke from escaping. Follow the product instructions carefully. In rural areas, where firearms can be used and it is safe to do so, skunks may be shot. Since they may spray in the process, be selective in the location chosen for this control method. There are no registered toxicants for poisoning skunks. Poison baits sold for the control of rodents should never be used in an attempt to remove skunks. The penalty for such pesticide misuse can be substantial, and illegal poisoning usually comes to light as a result of the accidental poisoning of someones pet. A few commercial products are available for repelling skunks, but unfortunately they are not very effective. A rag soaked with ordinary household ammonia has been used with some reported success as a home remedy repellent for driving skunks from beneath buildings. However, ammonia and other repellents with a strong odor should not be placed under an occupied building since fumes can enter the interior space, especially if air is drawn from beneath the building by a furnace or climate control system. Odor Removal There are several options for odor removal. The chemical neutroleum-alpha is one of the most useful neutralizers for removing the unpleasant skunk scent on furniture or in buildings, but this material and products containing it are not readily available. There are also other commercial products sold for neutralizing or masking skunk odor. If you cannot find such products easily, contact a professional wildlife control operator who may be able to provide neutroleum-alpha or can tell you where it can be purchased. Do not use neutroleum-alpha on pets or people. If your dog or cat has confronted a skunk, call your veterinarian to determine current recommendations for washing the animal to get rid of skunk odor. A home remedy formulation reported by some to be effective is as follows: 1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide 1/4 cup baking soda and 1 teaspoon liquid soap. Once the hydrogen peroxide is mixed with the baking soda the mixture is unstable and generates oxygen and cannot be bottled or stored. Apparently, oxidation changes the chemical composition of skunk scent so that it no longer smells. When the fresh mixture is applied to items contaminated by skunk odor, the smell diminishes quickly. Any leftover mixture should be diluted several fold with water and poured down the drain. Hydrogen peroxide mixtures can be used safely on pets and people as well as on clothing and furniture. However, care should be taken to keep the mixture out of the eyes. Rinse pets thoroughly with water after treatment. Skunk Bites Rabies, an infectious disease caused by a virus, is found in the saliva of infected animals. It affects only mammals and is transmitted most commonly by a bite. People can survive the bite of a rabid animal but only if medical attention is received in time. A physician should promptly attend to ALL skunk bites, no matter how minor; and the local health department should be notified of the incident. Skunks that seem tame or listless and wander about in an unusual manner during daylight hours should be treated with great caution because this behavior is symptomatic of rabies. Also, if they exhibit no fear of people or pets and show some aggressive behavior, chances are quite high that they are rabid. If you live in an area where skunks occur, be sure your dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated against rabies. Some dogs will confront skunks whenever they get an opportunity. Even though they suffer when they get sprayed, some dogs never learn. People with a high risk of occupational exposure to rabies should also consult with their physician about the possible benefit of being vaccinated.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Wild radish is a winter or summer annual, or sometimes a biennial broadleaf. In California both wild radish and radish, Raphanus sativus, are widespread and where they occur together they readily hybridize. The resulting offspring pose a problem for identification to species because of the range of characteristics they exhibit. Wild radish is found throughout California except for deserts, up to 2600 feet (800 m) and radish is found throughout except for deserts, the Great Basin, and some mountain areas, to 3300 feet (1000 m). Both are susceptible to several diseases and pests that damage a variety of crops. These pests include flea beetle, thrips, blackleg of brassicas, and turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus (TYMV). They also attract several beneficial predators of crop pests, as well as bees. Wild radish can be found in agricultural fields and other disturbed sites. Habitat Crop fields, orchards, vineyards, neglected gardens, parks, roadsides, and other disturbed locations. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are kidney to broadly heart shaped, about 2/5 to 4/5 inch (12 cm) long, with a deep notch at the tip and a base that abruptly tapers to a hairless stalk. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. The seedlings resemble mustards in the genus Brassica but are duller green and more roughly textured. Both the first true leaves and a few later leaves have a long football shape, a base that tapers or is deeply lobed once or twice, irregularly round-toothed edges, and attach to the stem on long stalks. Both the first true leaves and later few leaves have a long football shape, a base that tapers or is deeply lobed once or twice, irregularly round-toothed edges, and are attached to the stem with long stalks. Young plant Plants exist as rosettes until the flower stem develops at maturity. Mature plant Mature plants are erect, up to 2 feet (1.2 m) tall, and usually branch in the upper portion. Leaves vary in size and shape, but are usually sparsely covered with stiff, flattened hairs, especially toward the base. Lower leaves range from football to egg shaped, deeply lobed (but sometimes weakly lobed) to deeply divided into leaflets, have irregularly round edges or sharp toothed edges, and are typically 2-1/3 to 8 inches (620 cm) long. Upper leaves are reduced in size, football shaped, toothed, sometimes lobed at the base, and either stalkless or on a short stalk. Flowers Flowers have four petals that are narrowed at the base, are generally 3/5 to 1 inch (15-25 mm) long, and may have dark violet veins. Wild radish flowering takes place from April through July. Flower petals range from white to a faded yellow, or pale purplish pink. Radish flowering takes place from February through July. Flower petals are usually pale purplish-pink and occasionally, white. Hybridized populations usually exhibit many flower colors, from white to purple to pink or light yellow brown with streaks of different colors. Fruits Seedpods are initially fleshy and with time become dry and corky. They are long and narrow, almost straight, roundish in cross-section, with a pointed tip. The pods do not open to release seed. Wild radish: Seedpods are mostly 1-3/5 to 3-1/6 inches (48 cm) long and 1/6 to 1/4 of an inch (46 mm) wide, with a nearly uniform diameter for most of the length, and a beak about 2/5 to 4/5 of an inch (12 cm) long. Dry pods are noticeably constricted between seeds. Radish: Dried seedpods have straight sides or may have slight constrictions between seeds. The diameter is largest below the middle and tapers toward the end of the pod. Seeds Seed are round to egg shaped, from less than 1/10 of an inch up to 1/6 of an inch (24 mm) long and roughly 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) wide. They are brown, reddish brown, or yellowish brown. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Cultivated radish, Raphanus sativus',\n",

Their larvae primarily feed on fungi and organic matter in soil, but also chew roots and can be a problem in greenhouses, nurseries, potted plants and interior plantscapes. Adult fungus gnats may emerge from houseplants indoors and become a nuisance.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Fungus gnats (Orfelia and Bradysia species), also called darkwinged fungus gnats (Sciaridae), are dark, delicate-looking flies similar in appearance to mosquitoes. Adult fungus gnats have slender legs with segmented antennae that are longer than their head. Their long antennae distinguish them from the more robust shore flies, which are also found in greenhouses, associated with algae and decomposing organic matter, but have short bristle-like antennae. Although a few species are up to 12 inch long, fungus gnat adults commonly are about 116 to 18 inch long. Wings are light gray to clear, and the common Bradysia species have a Y-shaped wing vein. Because adult fungus gnats are attracted to light, you first might notice these pests flying near windows indoors. However, in comparison with more active species such as the common housefly (Musca domestica), fungus gnats are relatively weak fliers and usually dont move around much indoors. Fungus gnats often remain near potted plants and run across (or rest on) growing media, foliage, compost, and wet mulch piles. Females lay tiny eggs in moist organic debris or potting soil. Larvae have a shiny black head and an elongated, whitish-to-clear, legless body. They eat organic mulch, leaf mold, grass clippings, compost, root hairs, and fungi. If conditions are especially moist and fungus gnats are abundant, larvae can leave slime trails on the surface of media that look like trails from small snails or slugs. Fungus gnats develop through four stages egg, larva (with four larval stages or instars), pupa, and adult. The tiny eggs and oblong pupae occur in damp organic media where females lay eggs and larvae feed. At 75F, eggs hatch in about 3 days, the larvae take approximately 10 days to develop into pupae, and about 4 days later the adults emerge. A generation of fungus gnats (from female to female) can be produced in about 17 days depending upon temperature. The warmer it is, the faster they will develop and the more generations will be produced in a year. Fungus gnats have many overlapping generations each year. Outdoors, they are most common during winter and spring in interior areas of California, when water is more available and cooler temperatures prevail. They can occur during any time of the year in moist coastal regions and indoors.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Adult fungus gnats dont damage plants or bite people; their presence is primarily considered a nuisance. Larvae, however, when present in large numbers, can damage roots and stunt plant growth, particularly in seedlings and young plants. Significant root damage and even plant death have been observed in interior plantscapes and in houseplants when high populations were associated with moist, organically-rich soil. Thus, a houseplant that is wilting may not indicate a lack of water, but rather root damage by fungus gnat larvae or (more commonly) other causes of unhealthy roots. However, too much or too little water, root decay fungi, and improper soil conditions (e.g., poor drainage, or waterlogging) are much more common causes of wilted plants. Serious fungus gnat damage is more common in greenhouses, nurseries, and sod farms. Although larvae also feed on plant roots outdoors, they dont usually cause serious damage.',\n",
       "       'management': 'Most of the fungus gnats life is spent as a larva and pupa in organic matter or soil, so the most effective control methods target these immature stages rather than attempting to directly control the mobile, short-lived adults. Physical and cultural management tacticsprimarily the reductions of excess moisture and organic debrisare key to reducing fungus gnat problems. Commercially-available and naturally-occurring biological control agents can also control this pest. Insecticides are considered an important control option in some commercial plant production but generally arent recommended for fungus gnat management in and around the home. Monitoring Visual inspection for adults usually is adequate for determining whether a problem exists. You will see adults resting on plants, soil, windows, or walls, or you might see them in flight. Besides looking for adults, check plant pots for excessively moist conditions and organic debris where larvae feed. Yellow sticky traps can be used to trap adults. Chunks of raw potato placed in pots with the cut sides down (not the peels) are sometimes used to monitor for larvae. Water and Soil Management Because fungus gnats thrive in moist conditions, especially where there is an abundance of decaying vegetation and fungi, avoid overwatering and provide good drainage. Allow the surface of container soil to dry between waterings. Clean up standing water, and eliminate any plumbing or irrigation system leaks. Moist and decomposing grass clippings, compost, organic fertilizers, and mulches are also favorite breeding spots. Avoid using incompletely-composted organic matter in potting media unless it is pasteurized first, because it will often be infested with fungus gnats. Improve the drainage of the potting mix (e.g., increase the proportion of perlite or sand in the mix). Minimize organic debris around buildings and crops. Avoid fertilizing with excessive amounts of manure, blood meal, or similar organic materials. Screen and caulk leaky windows and doors to help prevent pests from coming indoors. If you have infested plants, dont move them to new areas where flies can emerge to infest other pots. In some cases you may wish to toss out severely infested plants. Purchase and use only pasteurized container mix or potting mix. Commercial growers often treat potting soil with heat or steam before using it; this will kill flies and the algae and microorganisms they feed on. Home gardeners can solarize soil: Moisten it. Place it in a bag of transparent plastic or black plastic. Make the pile no deeper than about 8 inches. Place the bagged soil on a slightly elevated surface, such as a pallet in a sunny location, for about 4 to 6 weeks. See the Pest Note: Soil Solarization for details. Store pasteurized potting soil off the ground and in closed containers to prevent it from becoming infested before use. Trapping In home situations where fungus gnat adults are a nuisance, it may be possible to reduce the problem by using sticky traps available at retail nursery and garden centers. Yellow sticky traps can be cut into smaller squares, attached to wooden skewers or sticks and placed in pots to trap adults. Also, raw potato chunks placed in the soil are very attractive to fungus gnat larvae. These may be used not only to check pots for larvae but also to trap them away from plant roots. After a few days in a pot, remove infested chunks, dispose of them, and replace with fresh ones. Biological Control Three commercially available biological control agents can be purchased to control fungus gnats in pots or container media (Table 1). These include Steinernema nematodes, Hypoaspis predatory mites, and the biological insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti). Several Bti products (Mosquito Bits, Gnatrol) are readily available in retail nurseries and garden centers, so these products may be the most convenient for home gardeners to use. Bti does not reproduce or persist indoors, so infestations in potting media might require repeated applications at about five-day intervals to provide control. Nematodes and Hypoaspis mites must be mail-ordered and are live and perishable products, requiring immediate application. Nematodes can provide relatively long-term control of fungus gnat larvae, and they can be self-reproducing after several inoculative applications to establish their populations. Steinernema feltiae is more effective against fungus gnats than other commercially available nematode species. Mix Bti or nematodes with water, and apply as a soil drench, or spray onto media using a hand-pump spray bottle or other spray equipment, following label directions. Several natural enemies help to manage fungus gnat populations in outdoor systems, such as landscapes and gardens, and indoors in greenhouses and conservatories, including the predatory hunter flies, Coenosia spp. These flies catch and consume adult fungus gnats in mid-air, and prey on fungus gnat larvae in soil while developing as larvae themselves. Conserve these and other natural enemies by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticide applications. Table 1. Commercially Available Biological Pesticides and Natural Enemies for Controlling Fungus Gnat Larvae. Biological Comments Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti) (Gnatrol) A naturally occurring, spore-forming bacterium produced commercially by fermentation. Bti applied at labeled rates provides temporary control and is toxic only to fly larvae, such as mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. Repeat applications commonly are needed for long-term control. This Bt is a different subspecies from that applied to foliage to control caterpillars. Bt labeled for caterpillars is not effective against fly larvae. Hypoaspis (= Geolaelaps or Stratiolaelaps) miles A light-brownish predaceous mite adapted to feeding in the upper layers of moist soil. Preys on fungus gnat larvae and pupae, thrips pupae, springtails, and other tiny invertebrates. Commercial mites commonly are shipped in a shaker-type container used to apply them. Recommended rates in commercial nurseries are about 1/2 to several dozen mites per container or square foot of media. Make applications before pests become abundant. Hypoaspis probably wont perform very well in individual houseplants and probably isnt a good choice for use in homes. Steinernema feltiae This nematode is effective when temperatures are between 60 to 90F and conditions are moist. You can apply it as a soil drench and to media using conventional spray equipment. Nematodes reproduce and actively search for hosts, so under moist conditions they can provide season-long control after several initial applications to establish populations. These materials are essentially nontoxic to people and are compatible for application in combination. Bt is available from many well-stocked nurseries and garden supply stores. Predaceous mites, Bti, and nematodes, are commercially available through mail order from special suppliers. Chemical Control Insecticides are rarely warranted to control these flies in and around homes. However, if you do apply an insecticide for fungus gnats, consider using Bti or Steinernema feltiae nematodes to control the larvae; see the section Biological Control for more information. If Bti or nematodes arent available and high populations are intolerable, pyrethrins or a pyrethroid insecticide may provide temporary, fast-acting control. Spray the surface of potting soil and plant parts where adults typically rest. Do not aerially fog indoors or attempt to spray adult gnats in flight. Be sure the product is labeled for your particular use (e.g., for \"house plants\") and read and follow the product\\'s directions. Pyrethrins have low toxicity to people and pets and are the active ingredients in the botanical pyrethrum, which is derived from flowers of certain chrysanthemums. Many products include a petroleum-derived synergist (piperonyl butoxide, or PBO) to increase pyrethrum effectiveness. Pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, permethrin) are synthesized from petroleum to be chemically similar to pyrethrins; they often are more effective and persistent but are more toxic to beneficial insects. When using these products on houseplants or interiorscape containers, if possible move plants outdoors for treatment as a precaution, and wait about a day after applying the chemical before bringing them back inside. For information on managing fungus gnats in commercial flower, nursery or greenhouse operations, see the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines: Floriculture and Ornamental Nurseries and the book Integrated Pest Management for Floriculture and Nurseries.'},\n",

High redgum lerp psyllid populations secrete copious honeydew and cause premature leaf drop. Sticky honeydew, the resulting dark sooty mold growth, and falling leaves foul surfaces beneath infested trees. Extensive defoliation weakens trees, can increase tree susceptibility to damage from other insects and diseases affecting eucalyptus, and contributes to premature death of some highly susceptible species. At some locations, abundant yellowjackets feeding on honeydew may annoy or threaten people. Redgum lerp psyllid infests over two dozen Eucalyptus species. In California this psyllid prefers river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), flooded gum (E. rudis), and forest red gum (E. tereticornis). Certain Eucalyptus species are avoided or are not heavily infested by this psyllid (Table 1).',\n",
       "       'management': 'The species of eucalyptus primarily determines whether psyllids will be abundant. Cultural practices and overall tree health also influence populations and the extent to which trees are damaged. Providing adequate irrigation and limiting nitrogen can reduce susceptibility to damage. An introduced, psyllid-specific parasitic wasp is providing substantial biological control on coastal area trees. Systemic insecticides have sometimes provided control, but efficacy has been variable and sometimes disappointing. Eucalyptus trees in California are attacked by at least 14 other introduced insects, including the bluegum psyllid (Ctenarytaina eucalypti), eucalyptus longhorned borers (Phoracantha recurva and P. semipunctata), and eucalyptus snout beetle or gumtree weevil (Gonipterus scutellatus), which are now under good biological control. Learn how management efforts may affect the other introduced eucalyptus pests before taking any control actions. In particular, consult the Pest Notes on eucalyptus longhorned borers, eucalyptus tortoise beetle, and psyllids . Monitoring Inspect valued eucalyptus regularly to detect problems with tree-growing environment and care as well as psyllids and their natural enemies. Dont wait until infestations are severe to monitor trees because cultural practices such as changes in irrigation or nitrogen application are primarily preventive and must be applied early. Where severe psyllid infestations are intolerable, identify those trees, but consider delaying any pesticide application until the following winter or early spring. It may be unrealistic to expect good control from actions taken after pests become abundant. The number of lerp coverings is not a good indication of psyllid abundance. Some nymphs form multiple lerps and leave their old whitish covers empty. Other covers have small parasite emergence holes or harbor nymphs that are parasitized. Use yellow sticky traps to capture adult psyllids and parasitic wasps. Monitoring traps for adults is more efficient than inspecting foliage for immatures. There is a positive correlation between the number of psyllid nymphs and eggs on leaves and adult female psyllids caught in yellow sticky traps. Yellow sticky traps provide a strong indication of seasonal changes in psyllid and parasite activity. Be sure to keep records of natural enemy activity. Avoid spraying trees with high psyllid-specific parasitization rates. Table 1. Approximate Relative Susceptibility of Eucalyptus Species to Several Introduced Pests in California.

Adapted partly from: Brennan et al. 2001, Hanks et al. 1995. Biological Control Redgum lerp psyllid is attacked by many predators including birds, the convergent lady beetle (Hippodamia convergens) and multicolored Asian lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis), green lacewings (Chrysoperla spp.) and syrphid flies, pirate bugs (Anthocoris spp.), and spiders. Dragonflies (Order Odonata) will hover near infested trees and catch adult psyllids in mid-air. Although predators do not provide complete biological control, they can reduce psyllid abundance. Whenever possible, select management efforts that have less adverse effects on these beneficial species. A psyllid-specific parasitic wasp (Psyllaephagus bliteus) that feeds only on redgum lerp psyllid has been introduced from Australia. Adult P. bliteus are about 1/12-inch-long encyrtid wasps with metallic green bodies and yellowish legs. At moderate temperatures, female parasites lay on average over 100 eggs during their 2-month life span. Females lay eggs in psyllid nymphs of any age, usually in third and fourth instars. Parasite larvae feed and develop only when nymphs reach the fifth (last) instar. After killing their host, wasps pupate and emerge, leaving a roundish emergence hole in parasitized psyllid nymphs and their lerp covers. Psyllaephagus bliteus has significantly reduced psyllid populations at coastal locations, especially in southern California. At warmer interior locations in Californias Central Valley, the parasite has not yet provided good biological control. Cultural Control Minimize stress by providing eucalyptus trees with proper cultural care and protecting them from injury. Consider providing trees with supplemental water during periods of prolonged drought, such as during summer and fall in much of California. Drought stress increases damage to trees from both lerp psyllids and eucalyptus longhorned borers. If irrigating trees, apply water beneath the outer canopy, not near trunks. Avoid frequent, shallow watering that is often used for lawns. A general recommendation is to irrigate eucalyptus trees infrequently (possibly once a month during drought periods) but with sufficient amounts so that the water penetrates deeply into soil (perhaps about 1 foot or more below the surface). This can be achieved by applying water slowly through drip emitters that run continuously for several days. In areas without an established irrigation system, a water tank truck can be used to temporarily flood soil. However, avoid prolonged water-logging, especially around the root crown, because eucalyptus trees are susceptible to pathogens favored by wet soils, such as Armillaria and Phytophthora root rots. The specific amount and frequency of water needed varies greatly depending on the site and tree species. Avoid fertilizing eucalyptus. Psyllid nymphs and egg-laying females prefer the abundant, succulent new shoot growth stimulated by excess nitrogen. Eucalyptus rarely require nitrogen fertilization for good growth. A six-year study of river red gum found no significant affect on tree size or survival due to annual nitrogen application. If other plants within the drip line of the tree require fertilization, use slow-release nutrient formulations. Consider pruning off limbs that overhang surfaces where dripping honeydew is especially intolerable. Be aware that pruning often stimulates new growth of succulent foliage, which is preferred by psyllids. Except for dead or hazardous branches, which should be removed whenever they appear, prune eucalyptus only during December or January (in southern California) or November through March (in northern California). Trees are usually less stressed at this time of the year and adult eucalyptus longhorned borers, which are attracted to fresh tree wounds, are not active. Do not prune too much during one season. If extensive limb removal is planned, space the trimming over several years so that trees maintain adequate foliage to produce food and extensive portions of previously shaded bark are not suddenly exposed to direct sunlight, which can result in sunburn cankers. Pest-Resistant Eucalyptus Choose eucalyptus species that are well adapted to the location, including tolerance to the prevailing moisture conditions. Although certain eucalyptus trees are drought-tolerant, other species are adapted to more moist conditions. It may not be apparent that eucalyptus trees are stressed due to drought or other factors until trees become affected by additional damaging influences, such as abundant insects. Planting resistant species can prevent redgum lerp psyllid from being a problem, as only a few species become highly infested. When selecting new or replacement species, also consider their susceptibility to other key pests. Consult Table 1 for a list of the approximate reported susceptibility to eucalyptus longhorned borers, redgum lerp psyllid, and tortoise beetle. Chemical Control Insecticide efficacy has been variable. Consider treating only those trees where the pest has been intolerable or tree health appears threatened by insects. Insecticides can adversely affect Psyllaephagus bliteus parasites and beneficial predators. Leave at least some nearby eucalyptus untreated to provide a refuge for natural enemies. Avoid treating trees in coastal areas where the natural enemy parasite is well established. Foliar sprays generally are not recommended. The lerp helps protect psyllid nymphs from spray contact. There are no selective insecticides that kill only psyllids. It is difficult to spray large urban trees without pesticide drifting off-target. If honeydew is intolerable and trees are small enough to be thoroughly sprayed, consider using a mixture of insecticidal soap (potassium salts of fatty acids) and horticultural oil (an insecticide labeled narrow-range, superior, or supreme oil). These low-hazard insecticides can be combined together at one-half of the labeled rate or the full labeled rate (commonly 1 to 2% active ingredient each). Oil and soap will kill some of the psyllid adults, eggs, and nymphs that are not covered by the lerps, and help to wash off honeydew. Oil and soap sprays are not highly effective against lerp psyllids and foliar spraying provides only temporary control. The most effective materials for large trees are systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid (Imicide, Merit). Certain formulations of imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Garden Tree & Shrub Insect Control and Pointer) are available to the home gardener. Limited research has been conducted on pesticide efficacy. Proper treatment timing is difficult to determine. It is not known why some users report good control with insecticide while others find disappointing results. Systemic insecticides are available for application into trunks or roots or by spraying foliage. Imidacloprid is also available to both home gardeners and professionals for application on or into soil beneath trees. When using systemics, whenever possible consider making a soil application instead of injecting or implanting trees. Injecting or implanting trunks or roots injures trees, and it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. Especially avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject roots or trunks more than once a year. Foliar sprays of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides are not recommended because of drift and negative impacts on natural enemies. Imidacloprid may be effective when applied to soil during late winter to early spring, or before rainfall or irrigation are expected to facilitate root absorption of the insecticide. Summer application to stressed, heavily infested trees is less likely to be effective and is not recommended. For more discussion and illustrations on using systemic insecticides, consult Pest Notes: Hackberry Woolly Aphid .'},\n",

Various other insects can cause damage that resembles caterpillar chewing, but these other insects do not produce silk strands or webbing. Other leafroller species may occur on the same plant. Omnivorous leafroller larvae have a brown to cream-colored or greenish-brown body up to 3/5 inch long. Larvae have a black or brown head and prothoracic shield, the area just behind the head and on the top and sides of the first abdominal segment. Through the translucent cuticle (outer covering) the main blood vessel running along the back is often visible as a faint dark stripe. The mounds (tubercles) at the base of the bristles along the top and sides are chalky white. Adults are small, dark-brown moths up to 1/2 inch long with a dark band on the wing and a distinct snout. At rest adults appear bell shaped, as do those of other tortricid species.',\n",

Clean up gardens by removing weeds that can be alternate hosts of leafroller larvae. Eliminate plant debris that can harbor pupae. Hand removal of webbed leaves and larvae can help control leafrollers on small plants. Otherwise healthy plants tolerate the loss of some leaves. Low numbers of leafrollers do not warrant insecticide application. A properly timed foliar spray of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad controls leafroller larvae. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Pest Notes: Leafrollers on Ornamental and Fruit Trees'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Insects are not a common cause of residential lawn damage in California, but certain species may occasionally damage or kill turfgrass. Insect feeding can cause grass to turn yellow or brown or die, especially if the grass is already stressed. Damage usually begins in small, scattered patches, which may merge into large dead areas. However, lack of proper cultural care and use of inappropriate grass species in a particular location are much more likely to cause unhealthy or dying lawns than insects. Vertebrate predators such as skunks, raccoons, wild pigs, and birds may be attracted to turf infested by insects, especially white grubs in autumn, and cause further damage by uprooting grass in search of their prey. For more information about these pests see the vertebrate pests section of the UC IPM Home and Landscape web site. Disease-causing pathogens, excessive or inappropriate use of chemicals such as fertilizers and herbicides, and dog urine also produce damage resembling that of insects. Before taking any insect control action, be certain insects are causing the damage and not something else and that the insect pest is present in life stages susceptible to control actions.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Insects that may cause damage in California lawns include various root-, crown-, and leaf-feeding caterpillars; grubs, which include the larvae of scarab beetles such as the black turfgrass ataenius and masked chafers (white grubs); billbugs, which are weevils with white, grublike larvae; and chinch bugs, which are true bugs in the order Hemiptera. Leafhoppers may occur in lawns, sometimes causing yellowing of leaf blades; but they rarely occur in numbers justifying treatment. Leatherjackets, the larvae of crane flies, can sometimes cause significant damage by feeding on turfgrass roots and crowns in the cooler, wetter north coast areas of California in Humboldt and Del Norte Counties and at commercial sod farms but rarely are numerous enough to cause damage in other areas of California. See the UC Guide for Healthy Lawns for help in identifying features of key lawn insect pests. Each species produces somewhat different damage symptoms and must be managed differently. Table 1 shows damage symptoms associated with each species. Many other insects may be observed while examining grass. However, control is rarely or never needed for most types of insects because they are harmless or beneficial. Common beneficial insects include predatory ants, ground beetles, rove beetles, and blister beetles. Other common arthropods that are primarily decomposers and do no significant injury to turfgrass include springtails and millipedes. MANAGING LAWN INSECTS (See UC Guide To Healthy Lawns) Following good cultural practices is the primary method for managing insect damage to lawns. Growing appropriate grass species for a particular climatic region and providing lawns with proper care are especially important. Practices such as irrigating and fertilizing have a major impact on lawn health. Practices such as thatch removal, choice of mowing height and frequency, and providing grass with more light by pruning tree branches are also important in certain situations. Naturally occurring biological control agents, such as predators and parasites, may limit some insect pests. Most home lawns in California do not need to be treated with pesticides if proper cultural practices are followed. Pesticides should never be applied unless a pest has been identified, is present at damaging levels, and is present in a susceptible life stage. If pesticide applications are necessary, choose IPM-compatible materials (Table 2) that have minimum impacts on beneficial organisms and the environment. Preventing Pest Problems The best way to prevent damage from lawn pests is to keep grass healthy. Healthy lawns require few, if any, pesticide applications. Also, if the turfgrass is under stress and a pesticide is applied, it stands a greater chance of suffering phytotoxic damage from the pesticide itself. The UC Guide to Healthy Lawns on the UC IPM web site and the publications on managing your lawn listed in References give detailed information on how to grow a healthy lawn. Table 1 lists cultural practices important for preventing specific problems. Choose Appropriate Varieties There are a number of grasses available for planting in California. These grasses are often referred to as either cool-season grasses (examples include bentgrass, fine fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, and tall fescue) or warm-season grasses (bermudagrass, kikuyugrass, St. Augustinegrass, seashore paspalum, zoysiagrass, and buffalograss). Warm-season grasses produce most of their growth during summer and usually have a dormant period when they turn brown during winter. Cool-season grasses are green year-round, but they produce most of their growth in spring and fall. The type of grass and the varieties within each type vary in their shade tolerance, salinity tolerance, water needs, disease resistance, and cultural needs. A formerly thriving lawn variety may decline with changes in light, such as more or less shade caused by growth or removal of nearby trees. These factors are outlined in Turfgrass Selection for the Home Landscape . Selection of the appropriate grass species and variety will allow you to grow a hardy lawn with minimal maintenance inputs. Care for Lawns Properly Inappropriate irrigation is the most common cause of lawn damage. Overwatering (shallow, frequent sprinkling) predisposes turf to diseases, retards deep root growth, and increases lawn susceptibility to stress. Poorly maintained sprinklers can apply too much water in certain spots while underwatering other areas. Brown spots from uneven water applications occur frequently and are often caused by improperly spaced sprinkler heads, sunken or tilted heads, or unmatched heads that apply differing amounts of water. Correcting these physical problems with irrigation systems can decrease water waste significantly, decrease water bills, and, most importantly, improve the health of your lawn. Lawns should be irrigated deeply and not more than twice a week. Appropriate fertilization encourages a dense, thick lawn that allows grass to tolerate some insect feeding. The appropriate timing and amount of fertilizer (primarily nitrogen) varies depending on factors including season, grass species, and local growing conditions. In general, most California grasses used for lawns require from 2 to 4 pounds of actual nitrogen over a 1,000 square foot area annually during their active growing season. Some native grasses and drought tolerant species like buffalograss and fine leaf fescue may require less. If grasscycling is practiced (leaving lawn clippings on the lawn after mowing, instead of removing), then the lower rate of nitrogen application may be used. Keep the blades on your lawn mower sharp and cut your turf at a mowing height appropriate for that type of lawn grass so as to minimize depletion of food reserves needed to outgrow insect injury. Mowing frequency and height depend on grass species, season, and the particular use of that lawn. Cool-season lawns have suggested mowing heights of 1 1/2 to 3 inches, while warm-season lawns should be mowed to a height of 3/4 to 1 inch. No more than 1/3 of the grass height should be removed at one time. Lawns also benefit from aeration. To increase water penetration and reduce soil compaction, periodically remove soil plugs using hollow tines. In bluegrass and bermudagrass lawns, thatch (the layer of undecomposed organic material on the soil surface) can build up and result in poor water, fertilizer, and air penetration, as well as provide a protected home for many unwanted pests and pathogens. Presently, most California lawns are planted with tall fescue, which is not as susceptible to thatch buildup as other species. Thatch that is greater than 1/2 inch thick encourages caterpillar and chinch bug populations. Thatch also reduces insecticide efficacy because insecticides cannot penetrate to reach root-feeding insects. Prevent thatch by avoiding excess nitrogen application, irrigating deeply and infrequently, and minimizing the use of broad-spectrum lawn pesticides that can reduce populations of microorganisms responsible for decomposing the thatch. If more than 1/2 inch thick, physically remove thatch with a mechanical dethatcher, vertical mower, or power rake. Other methods (although not as effective in reducing thatch) include topdressing lawns by adding a thin layer (1/81/4 inch) of soil and raking or sweeping it into the thatch to encourage decomposer microorganisms. Core aerification also mixes soil into thatch, speeding decomposition. Biological Control Certain insects, other invertebrates, and microorganisms that occur naturally in lawns feed on or parasitize lawn pests. This type of control, called biological control, may help to prevent many lawn-dwelling insects from becoming pests. To protect beneficial insects, avoid using broad-spectrum pesticides (such as carbaryl, neonicotinoids, and pyrethroids) that will kill them along with the pests. Some biological pesticides containing live organisms, such as entomopathogenic nematodes or biological metabolites from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and other organisms, are commercially available for controlling specific lawn insects. These materials have minimal impacts on natural enemies of insect pests and other beneficial organisms such as earthworms. Birds, moles, and other vertebrates also feed on lawn insects from time to time. Detecting Problems in Your Lawn Examine your lawn weekly, or just before each mowing, to detect problem areas. At the same time, look for weeds. A dense stand of healthy grass prevents most weeds from growing, so abundant weed growth indicates that the lawn is unhealthy and susceptible to other pests. New turfgrass is especially vulnerable to problems and has different irrigation and fertilizer requirements than established turfgrass. An indication that a lawn may be infested with insects is when the adults (e.g., moth or beetle stage) of pests are drawn to lights at night or when vertebrate predators (birds, raccoons, or skunks) are digging in your lawn for caterpillars and grubs. However, the insects coming to light may be drawn from far away, and vertebrate activity is not a foolproof indicator. They may be feeding on earthworms instead of insects; also, vertebrates will return to where they previously found food, so they may dig in lawns even if insect pests are no longer abundant. If you observe damage, the next step is to determine the actual cause. Since inappropriate watering is the most common cause of lawn damage, check your irrigation system first to make sure all nozzles are functioning properly and that adequate and uniform coverage is provided, as discussed above. If you think the damage is caused by insects, confirm your suspicions by looking for the pest. The most accurate way to do this is by using either the drench test or by inspecting around roots (Table 2). The drench test is effective for detecting chinch bugs and caterpillars, including armyworms, cutworms, and sod webworms; but it does not detect grubs. Locating and correctly identifying a pest is important because different pests are managed differently. Some may not require treatment. If treatment is required, then materials, timing, and application methods will vary according to pest species. Identify the insects you find using descriptions in this publication and the online UC Guide to Healthy Lawns . After identifying the insects, count the number of each type of insect found. Some of the insects you find may be beneficial or nondamaging. In home lawns, you usually only need to be concerned with the insects listed in Table 1 . This graph shows approximate times when you might expect to see common pests in your lawn. Remember that the mere presence of an insect pest does not imply that it is the cause of unhealthy lawns or that an insecticide treatment is needed. It is normal to find a few pest insects in any healthy lawn. Generally, treatments are not recommended unless the population level of the insect pest reaches a predetermined level called a threshold (Table 2). Thresholds are the population levels at which the number of insects feeding exceeds the ability of a healthy lawn to withstand the damage they cause. For example, an insecticide usually is not needed unless there are more than about 5 armyworms and cutworms or 15 lawn moth larvae per square yard. Sample several different areas of the lawn to better estimate the overall population levels, especially if numbers are close to suggested thresholds. Table 1. Some Lawn Pests, Appearance of Their Damage, and Cultural Control Methods. Pest (Scientific name) Hosts Damage appearance Cultural control armyworms, cutworms (Mythimna (= Pseudaletia) unipuncta, Peridroma saucia, Agrotis spp.) all grasses, dichondra leaves and base of leaves chewed and cut beginning in small, irregular spots that can spread to patches extending many feet in width reduce thatch; eliminate soggy areas; overseed lawn billbugs (Sphenophorus spp.) all grasses brown, thin, dying grass, beginning in small, irregular spots that can spread to patches extending many feet in width irrigate and fertilize adequately; increase mowing height black turfgrass ataenius (Ataenius spretulus) annual bluegrass, bentgrass, ryegrass, Kentucky bluegrass brown, dying grass, few roots; lawn is easily peeled off soil increase mowing height; aerate to improve root growth crane fly (Tipula paludosa) all grasses primarily in Humbolt and Del Norte counties; dying patches of grass with cranefly larvae feeding on roots and crowns avoid over-irrigation and poor drainage situations; remove excess thatch fiery skipper (Hylephila phyleus) bentgrass, bermudagrass, St. Augustinegrass 1- to 2-inch-diameter spots of lawn turn brown; spots may join to form large, irregular dead patches; leaves chewed or missing reduce thatch; overseed with grass species that are not preferred lawn moths, sod webworms (Crambus sperryellus, Tehama bonifatella) all grasses, especially bentgrass, bluegrass, clovers lawn brown; leaves chewed or missing reduce thatch; irrigate and fertilize appropriately southern chinch bug (Blissus insularis) primarily St. Augustinegrass irregular patches of lawn turn yellowish, then brown and begin dying during hot weather reduce thatch; reduce nitrogen fertilization; irrigate adequately; plant resistant varieties such as Floralawn, Floratam, or FX-10 if growing St. Augustinegrass white grubs immatures of masked chafers (Cyclocephala spp.), May and June beetles (Phyllophaga spp.) All grasses, especially bluegrass, ryegrass brown dying grass ; lawn can be rolled up if heavily infested irrigate and fertilize appropriately; overseed lawn Some pests specific to bermudagrass and dichondra are not included in this table. Other invertebrates that occasionally damage lawns include frit flies and other flies, flea beetles, leafhoppers, Lucerne moths, plant bugs, mealybugs, scale insects, and mites . Adapted from Ali and Elmore (1989) and Costa et al. (2000); for more information consult publications in References . Drench Test To detect chinch bugs, adult billbugs, and caterpillars, including armyworms, cutworms, and larvae of lawn moths (sod webworms), perform a drench test by mixing 1 to 2 fluid ounces (2-4 tablespoons) of dishwashing liquid to a gallon of water. If you are using a concentrate version of a dishwashing liquid, 1 1/2 tablespoons per gallon of water is adequate. Two gallons may be required where soils are dry. Apply the solution to 1 square yard of lawn as evenly as possible using a sprinkling can. Test an area that includes both relatively healthy grass and adjoining unhealthy grass. The drench will cause insects to move to the surface. During the next 10 minutes, identify and count the number of pest insects. Inspect Around Roots The drench test does not indicate the presence of billbug larvae, black turfgrass ataenius larvae, or white grubs (masked chafers, May beetles, and June beetles). To detect white grubs, dig or cut beneath thatch and examine the soil around roots and crowns (where roots and stems meet). Look for the white, legless larvae of billbugs (a weevil) or the C-shaped, six-legged larvae of scarab beetles, such as black turfgrass ataenius and masked chafers. When these are numerous, roots are eaten away and turf often can be rolled back like a carpet. If you find more than about 1 billbug larva, 6 white grubs, or 40 black turfgrass ataenius grubs per square foot, control may be needed. TREATMENT If cultural practices are not enough to prevent damage, and a drench test or root inspection indicates treatment is warranted, choose selective, least toxic, IPM-compatible products (Table 2) whenever possible to control pests. Microbial insecticides derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and entomopathogenic nematodes have minimal negative impacts on nontarget organisms. The insecticides azadirachtin, pyrethrum (pyrethrins), and spinosad also pose less risk for nontarget organisms. Each of these products is effective only on certain pests and must be properly timed and applied to be effective. Broad-spectrum insecticides, including carbaryl, chlorantraniliprole, imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids, and pyrethroids, such as bifenthrin, are available to control certain pests. However, these materials pose risks for beneficial, nontarget organisms and water quality. Avoid their use unless IPM-compatible insecticides cannot control the infestation. For more information on environmental and health impacts of the insecticides mentioned here visit the UC IPM Active Ingredient Database and the National Pesticide Information Database web sites or click on the Active Ingredients: Compare Risks button at the bottom of the online version of this publication. Avoid the use of lawn fertilizer products that also contain insecticides for preventive treatment. Insecticide treatment at the time of fertilizing is usually not justified and may reduce the presence of beneficial insects. Mow the lawn and reduce excess thatch (greater than 1/2 inch) before applying insecticides. Unless otherwise directed on the product label, irrigate and allow grass blades to dry before treating caterpillars and other insects that feed on grass blades and stems. Do not treat if rainfall is expected and do not irrigate for at least 48 hours after spraying for leaf-feeders to allow the insecticide to remain on grass blades as long as possible. When treating white grubs and other root-feeders, wait to irrigate until after application so the insecticide is moved down into the soil. Certain chemicals may injure lawns, especially if used on seedlings, when temperatures are too high, or if grass is stressed. Injury may also result from improper rates, repeated applications, wrong formulations, or from mixing incompatible materials. Inert ingredients, such as wetters, spreaders, emulsifiers, diluents, and solvents may also injure lawns. Azadirachtin The botanical pesticide azadirachtin is extracted from the seeds of the neem tree. It is used to control cutworms, armyworms, and the larvae of lawn moths. Azadirachtin is absorbed by the plant and is able to move to a limited degree within the plant. Because azadirachtin acts partly as an insect growth regulator (i.e., it prevents the caterpillar from reaching maturity), most caterpillars are not killed until several days after application; and azadirachtins effectiveness is not immediately apparent. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) kurstaki Bt subspecies kurstaki kills only caterpillars. When infected with Bt, caterpillars stop feeding within a day and usually die within a few days. Unlike broad-spectrum insecticides that kill on contact, caterpillars must eat Bt-sprayed foliage to be killed, so proper timing and thorough spray coverage are very important. Bt is most effective on caterpillars when they are young. Once the caterpillars become large they are harder to kill with this material, and other control measures may be necessary. Apply Bt during warm, dry weather when caterpillars are feeding actively. Sunlight inactivates Bt on foliage, so make applications in the evening. Repeat treatment after about 7 to 10 days. Carbaryl This carbamate insecticide is a cholinesterase inhibitor, exhibiting broad-spectrum activity against insects and other arthropods as well as moderate toxicity to people and other mammals. It will kill pests and beneficial insects on contact or when consumed and will persist in the application area for up to several weeks. Carbaryl should not be applied to blooming plants or to lawns containing clovers or other flowering plants since it is highly toxic to bees and other pollinators. Carbaryl can be used to kill large white grubs in late summer and fall but will not remedy the lawn damage that has already occurred and may not prevent grub damage the following year. Chlorantraniliprole This broad-spectrum anthranilic diamide insecticide interrupts the normal muscle contraction of insects, resulting in death. It adheres to plant surfaces and is most effective when consumed by pests. Therefore, it should only be applied when pest insects, such as grubs or caterpillars, are present at damaging levels and are actively consuming turf grass stems, blades, or roots. Chlorantraniliprole may negatively impact beneficial insects and other arthropods and is a potential water contaminant. Nematodes Entomopathogenic nematodes can be applied to control caterpillars or grubs. Each nematode species is effective on a different range of pests. Select the nematode species most effective against the target pest(s) (Table 2). All nematode species are most effective when applied during the early part of the season, when grubs or caterpillars are most active. A second application, about 2 weeks after the first, increases the likelihood that nematodes will reproduce and provide long-term pest management. Irrigate before and after application. Apply to warm (at least 60F), moist (but not soggy) soil. Several irrigations may be needed during the 2 weeks after each application to keep soil moist. Because nematodes are killed by light and heat, apply them in the evening, especially in hot areas. Nematodes usually must be ordered and then received by mail. Because they are very perishable, store them as directed (usually under cool, dark conditions), and do not store them for long periods. Purchase from a reputable producer or supplier of fresh nematodes, and check to make sure they are moving and alive before applying them. Neonicotinoids Imidacloprid and clothianidin are two broad-spectrum insecticides in the neonicotinoid group that affect the central nervous system of insects, resulting in paralysis and death. They are often used to manage lawn grubs, including white grubs, black turfgrass ataenius, and billbugs. To be most effective, neonicotinoids must be taken up by the plants and then consumed by target insects along with the plant tissue. Therefore, they must be applied when turf is growing and when (or immediately before) insects are actively feeding on turf. These products will not be effective against white grubs if applied in the spring before grubs hatch out; and they are less effective when applied too late in the season, when grass is not growing rapidly and grubs are not eating as much. Because initial effectiveness can be delayed for days after application, it may be best to apply during the early summer, when the grubs are in their earliest stages. In lawns that had damaging infestations the previous year, monitor for adults in May and June and make treatments when adults are found. If lawns are heavily infested with damaging levels of grubs later in the season, entomopathogenic nematodes and carbaryl will be the only pesticidal materials likely to kill these late stage grubs. Timing of treatments for billbugs, which may occur earlier in the season, will be different and more difficult. Neonicotinoids have negative impacts on earthworms, beneficial insects, and surface water quality. They are toxic to bees and other pollinators when applied to flowering plants (such as clovers) that may be in the lawn. Pyrethrins Pyrethrum, a botanically-derived contact insecticide made from flowers of certain chrysanthemums, contains pyrethrins, natural chemicals which alter nerve function in insects and other arthropods, resulting in paralysis and death. Many pyrethrum products include the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Insects may only be temporarily paralyzed (knocked-down), and pests may recover from temporary effects of exposure to pyrethrum unless piperonyl butoxide is added. Pyrethrins may persist in the application area for several days or more. Take care to keep pyrethrum applications away from streams and other surface water habitats since they are highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Pyrethroids These very common broad-spectrum insecticides are synthetic chemicals modeled after pyrethrins. Specific active ingredients used for lawn pest management include bifenthrin, gamma-cyhalothrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, and zeta-cypermethrin. They kill insects and arthropods through the same mode of action as pyrethrum but have been designed to persist much longer in the environment, meaning that spray residues remain active for several weeks or more. Pyrethroids are not effective against soil-dwelling pests, such as white grubs, since they bind tightly to soil particles and do not move easily from the surface into the root zone. Take care to keep applications away from streams and other surface water habitats and prevent runoff from treated surfaces since pyrethroids are highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Spinosad Spinosad is a naturally-based insecticide derived from soil microorganisms. It is effective against lawn caterpillar pests but does not control grubs or other beetles. Although considered organic in most cases, it is broad-spectrum in activity and can have negative impacts on bees and some beneficial insects for several days after application. Table 2.

       "      'body': {'description': 'Whiteflies are tiny, sap-sucking insects that may become abundant in vegetable and ornamental plantings, especially during warm weather. They excrete sticky honeydew and cause yellowing or death of leaves. Outbreaks often occur when the natural biological control is disrupted. Management is difficult once populations are high.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Despite their name, whiteflies are not true flies (in the insect order Diptera) but are in the order Hemiptera, related to aphids, scales and mealybugs. They derive their name from the mealy white wax covering the adults wings and body. Adults are tiny insects with yellowish bodies and four whitish wings. Although adults of some species have distinctive wing markings, many species are most readily distinguished in the last nymphal (immature) stage, which is wingless and lacks visible legs. Depending on species, whitefly nymphs vary in color from almost transparent yellow or whitish to black with a white fringe (Table 1). Whiteflies develop rapidly in warm weather, and populations can build up quickly in situations where natural enemies are ineffective and when weather and host plants favor outbreaks. Large colonies often develop on the undersides of leaves. The most common pest speciessuch as greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and sweetpotato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci)have a wide host range that includes many weeds and crops. These species breed all year round in warmer parts of California, moving from one host to another as plants are harvested or dry up. Another species of whitefly with a broad host range is the giant whitefly, Aleurodicus dugesii, which invaded Southern California in the early 1990s. It is now found in coastal areas and interior valleys in much of the state on a number of tropical and semi-tropical ornamental species. For more information on this species, see Pest Notes: Giant Whitefly. Other species of whiteflies, especially those on woody species, often have a more limited host range. Table 1 lists common whiteflies in California gardens and landscapes. Whiteflies normally lay their tiny oblong eggs on the undersides of leaves. The eggs hatch, and the young whiteflies gradually increase in size through four nymphal stages called instars. The first nymphal stage (crawler) is barely visible even with a hand lens. The crawlers move around for several hours before settling to begin feeding. Later nymphal stages are immobile, oval, and flattened, with greatly reduced legs and antennae, like small scale insects. The winged adult emerges from the last nymphal stage (sometimes called a pupa, although whiteflies dont have a true complete metamorphosis). All stages feed by sucking plant juices from leaves and excreting excess liquid as drops of honeydew as they feed.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Whiteflies use their piercing, needlelike mouthparts to suck sap from phloem, the food-conducting tissues in plant stems and leaves. Large populations can cause leaves to turn yellow, appear dry, or fall off plants. Like aphids, whiteflies excrete a sugary liquid called honeydew, so leaves may be sticky or covered with black sooty mold that grows on honeydew (See Pest Notes: Sooty Mold). The honeydew attracts ants, which interfere with the activities of natural enemies that may control whiteflies and other pests. Feeding by the immature sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, can cause plant distortion, discoloration, or silvering of leaves, and may cause serious losses in some vegetable crops. Some whiteflies transmit viruses to certain vegetable crops. Whiteflies are not normally a problem in fruit trees although their populations can build up in citrus, pomegranate and avocado. Several whitefly species occur on ornamental trees and shrubs (see Table 1), but most are uncommon because of natural controls such as parasites and predators. Most whiteflies on trees have limited host ranges. Low levels of whiteflies are not usually damaging. Adults by themselves will not cause significant damage unless they are transmitting a plant pathogen. Generally, plant losses do not occur unless there is a significant population of whitefly nymphs.',\n",
       "       'management': 'Management of heavy whitefly infestations is difficult. The best strategy is to prevent problems from developing in your garden or landscape. In many situations, natural enemies will provide adequate control of whiteflies; outbreaks often occur when natural enemies are disrupted by insecticide applications, dusty conditions, or interference by ants. Avoid or remove plants that repeatedly host high populations of whiteflies. In gardens, whitefly populations in the early stages of population development can be held down by a vigilant program of removing infested leaves or hosing down with water sprays. Reflective mulches can repel whiteflies from vegetable gardens, and yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor or, at high levels, reduce whitefly numbers. If you choose to use insecticides, insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem oil may reduce but not eliminate populations. Systemic insecticides may be more effective but can have negative impacts on beneficial insects and pollinators. Table 1. Major Economic Hosts of Some Common Whiteflies. Ash whitefly (Siphoninus phillyreae) Host plants: many broadleaved trees and shrubs including ash, citrus, Bradford pear and other flowering fruit trees, pomegranate, redbud, toyon. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have a very thick band of wax down the back and a fringe of tiny tubes, each with a liquid droplet at the end. Adults are white. Ash whitefly is now under good biological control in CA, so it is rarely seen in high numbers. Greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) Host plants: very broad including most vegetables and herbaceous ornamentals. Also may occur on avocado, fuchsia, gardenia, lantana and redbud. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have very long waxy filaments and a marginal fringe. Adults have white wings and a yellow surface or substrate. Bandedwinged whitefly (Trialeurodes abutilonea) Host plants: very broad including cotton, cucurbits, other vegetables. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have short, waxy filaments around their edges. Adults have brownish bands across the wings, and their body is gray. Iris whitefly (Aleyrodes spiraeoides) Host plants: iris, gladiolus, many vegetables, cotton and other herbaceous plants. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no fringe or waxy filaments but are located near distinctive circles of wax where egg laying took place. Adults have a dot on each wing and are quite waxy. Citrus whitefly (Dialeurodes citri) Host plants: citrus, gardenia, ash, ficus, pomegranate. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no fringe around their edges but have a distinctive Y-shape on their backs. Adults are white. Mulberry whitefly (Tetraleurodes mori) Host plants: avocado, citrus, mulberry, other trees. Characteristics: Nymphs have blackish, oval bodies with white, waxy fringe. Adults have reddish to gray wing markings. Crown whitefly (Aleuroplatus coronata) Host plants: oak, chestnut. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs are black with large amounts of white wax arranged in a crownlike pattern. Adults are white. Sweetpotato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) Host plants: very broad including many herbaceous and some woody plants including cole crops, cotton, cucurbits, tomatoes, peppers, crape myrtle, lantana, roses, and hibiscus. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no waxy filaments or marginal fringe. Adults have white wings and yellow body; they hold their wings slightly tilted to surface or substrate. Giant whitefly (Aleurodicus dugesii) Host plants: avocado, begonia, hibiscus, giant bird of paradise, orchid tree, banana, mulberry, vegetables, and many ornamentals. Characteristics: Adults are up to 0.19 inch long. They leave spirals of wax on leaves. Nymphs have long filaments of wax that can be up to 2 inches long and give leaves a bearded appearance. For more information, see Pest Notes : Giant Whitefly. Woolly whitefly (Aleurothrixus floccosus) Host plants: citrus, eugenia. Characteristics: Nymphs are covered with fluffy, waxy filaments. Adults are white. Biological Control Whiteflies have many natural enemies, and outbreaks frequently occur when these natural enemies have been disturbed or destroyed by pesticides, dust buildup, or other factors. General predators include lacewings, bigeyed bugs, and minute pirate bugs . Several small lady beetles including Clitostethus arcuatus (on ash whitefly) and scale predators, such as Scymnus or Chilocorus species, and the Asian multicolored lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, feed on whiteflies. Whiteflies have a number of naturally occurring parasites that can be very important in controlling some species. Encarsia spp. parasites are commercially available for release in greenhouse situations; however, they are not generally recommended for outdoor use because they are not well adapted for survival in temperate zones. You can evaluate the degree of natural parasitization in your plants by checking empty whitefly pupal cases. Those that were parasitized will have round or oval exit holes and those from which a healthy adult whitefly emerged will have a T-shaped exit hole. Whitefly nymphs can sometimes be checked for parasitization before emergence by noting a darkening in their color. However, some whitefly parasites do not turn hosts black; and some species of whitefly nymphs that occur on ornamentals are black in their healthy, unparasitized state. Avoiding the use of insecticides that kill natural enemies is a very important aspect of whitefly management. Products containing carbaryl, pyrethroids, or imidacloprid (especially as a foliar application) can be particularly disruptive. Control of dust and ants, which protect whiteflies from their natural enemies, can also be important, especially in citrus or other trees. Removal Hand removal of leaves or plants heavily infested with the nonmobile nymphal and pupal stages may reduce populations to levels that natural enemies can contain. Remove and destroy whitefly-infested vegetable plants after harvest. Always inspect new plants for whiteflies and nymphs before introducing them in the greenhouse or garden. If you have evergreen perennial plants that consistently host high populations of whiteflies in the winter season, then you may wish to remove these plants to lower overwintering populations. If you have high populations of whiteflies in a greenhouse, removing all host plants from the greenhouse for at least 2 weeks (and assuring that no whiteflies can enter from outside) may eliminate problems. Water sprays (syringing) may also be useful in dislodging adults. Watering can also reduce the hot, dry dusty conditions that favor whiteflies and inhibit their natural enemies. Reflective Mulches Shiny metallic-coated construction paper or reflective plastic mulches can repel whiteflies, especially away from small plants. Alternatively, you can spray clear plastic mulch with silver paint. Reflective plastic mulches are available online and in some garden stores. When putting a reflective mulch in your garden, first remove all weeds. Place the mulch on the plant beds and bury the edges with soil to hold them down. After the mulch is in place, cut 3- to 4-inch diameter holes and plant several seeds or single transplants in each one. You may be able to furrow irrigate or sprinkle your beds if you use coated construction paper or other porous mulch if it is sturdy enough to tolerate sprinkling. Plastic mulches will require drip irrigation. In addition to repelling whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers, the mulch will enhance crop growth and control weeds. Reflective mulches have been shown to deter pests that transmit viruses in commercial vegetable crops, perhaps helping to reduce disease incidence and crop loss. When summertime temperatures get high, remove mulches to prevent overheating plants. Traps In vegetable gardens, yellow sticky traps can be posted around the garden to trap adults. Such traps wont eliminate damaging populations but may reduce them somewhat as a component of an integrated management program relying on multiple tactics. Whiteflies do not fly very far, so many traps may be needed. You may need as many as one trap for every two large plants, with the sticky yellow part of the trap level with the whitefly infestation. Place traps with the sticky side facing plants but out of direct sunlight. Traps are most useful for monitoring and detecting whiteflies rather than controlling them. Commercial traps or sticky cards are available in stores and online. Additionally, you can make traps out of 1/4-inch plywood or masonite board, painted bright yellow, and mounted on pointed wooden stakes. Drive stakes into the soil close to the plants that are to be protected. Although commercially available sticky materials such as Tanglefoot are commonly used as coatings for the traps, you might want to try to make your own adhesive from one-part petroleum jelly or mineral oil and one-part household detergent. This material can be easily cleaned off boards with soap and water, whereas a commercial solvent must be used to remove the other adhesives. Periodic cleaning is essential to remove insects and debris from the boards and maintain the sticky surface. Insecticide Sprays Whiteflies can be difficult to control with insecticides. Most less-toxic products such as insecticidal soaps, neem oil, or petroleum-based oils control only those whiteflies that are directly sprayed. Therefore, plants must be thoroughly covered with the spray solution, and repeat applications may be necessary. Be sure to cover undersides of all infested leaves; usually these are the lowest leaves and the most difficult to reach. Use soaps or oils when plants are not drought-stressed and when temperatures are under 90F to prevent possible burn damage to plants. Early evening, when there is enough light to safely apply products but when the sun is not shining directly on plants, may be a good time to spray. The soil-applied systemic insecticide imidacloprid can control whitefly nymphs. Imidacloprid can have negative impacts on natural enemies, honey bees and other pollinators in the garden, especially when applied as a foliar spray or as a soil application to plants that are flowering or soon to be flowering. It can also cause outbreaks of spider mites. Reserve its use for special situations where these problems can be avoided. Avoid using other pesticides (other than soaps and oils) to control whiteflies; not only do most of them kill natural enemies, whiteflies quickly build up resistance to them, and most are not very effective in garden situations.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'The false chinch bug, Nysius raphanus (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), is a small insect commonly found within grassy or weedy fields, pastures, and foothills. Each spring, once the plants in these areas dry up, the false chinch bug migrates to find new places to feed. This becomes a nuisance for homeowners when these bugs migrate into their landscapes and homes and can cause problems for gardeners and farmers. False chinch bug problems often are most serious in years with wet, cool springs. Above average rainfall encourages abundant growth of weeds and grasses in areas with natural vegetation. Relatively cool spring and early summer weather prolongs the survival of these plants, resulting in greater increases in false chinch bug populations, which reproduce on this vegetation. Adults are grayish-brown, slender, and about 1/8 to 1/6 inch long. Like many other insects in the order Hemiptera, their forewings are partly thickened and partly membranous so when folded, the tips of the wings overlap, forming a fairly well-defined X on the back of the body (Figure 1). Immature stages (nymphs) lack wings and, from a distance, look like individual coffee grounds in size and color. Nymphs are a mottled gray brown often with reddish or orangish markings on the abdomen (Figure 2). Both immature and adult false chinch bugs feed on plants through a proboscis, a hypodermic-needlelike structure they use to probe into plant tissue and drink up plant fluids. This type of feeding can cause severe damage to plants that are unable to compensate for lost leaf tissue and sap. Dont confuse false chinch bugs with other similar-looking bugs in the same family, the seed bug family Lygaeidae. Bigeyed bugs, which are wider and have larger eyes, are beneficials that feed on pest insects and mites (Figure 3). These never occur in abundance as do false chinch bugs. Another Lygaeid, the southern chinch bug, Blissus insularis, sometimes feeds on turfgrass, but rarely does it significantly damage lawns in California, except for St. Augustine grass. Adults of this species are black with whitish wings.',\n",

After hatching, nymphs feed on weeds, especially mustards, molt three times, and develop into adults in about three weeks. There can be several generations a year. As weedy mustards and other cruciferous plants dry out and die, false chinch bugs move into irrigated crops or landscapes. Adults are good flyers and can move significant distances. False chinch bugs tend to aggregate in large groups on plants or on walls of houses.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'In normal years, false chinch bugs are considered a pest only of seedlings. Plants might wilt but only rarely die. Larger annual plants and established perennials have sufficient size to be relatively unaffected by attacks against them. However, when populations are high in wet years, the sheer numbers of these pests can cause alarm for farmers and homeowners alike. Homeowners have been particularly hard hit, as waves of these insects completely envelop garden and landscape plants. Some homeowners have stated that it appears as if the ground is moving. Also, small false chinch bugs often are able to get underneath sliding screen patio doors and enter into homes, where they become a nuisance. In rare situations, aggregations of false chinch bugs can result in plant and tree decline, and there have been reports of these bugs killing young almond, pistachio, pomegranate, and citrus trees. This level of damage typically is reported only from the lower San Joaquin Valley. Initial symptoms include wilting and a scorched appearance to the leaves, followed by total plant death; the constant probing and feeding from this pest essentially can suck young trees dry. The decline of young trees often is so rapid many entomologists have hypothesized the false chinch bug injects a toxin into the plant as part of the feeding process.',\n",
       "       'management': 'There are few management options for the false chinch bug in gardens and landscapes. Low numbers do not need to be managed, because most garden plants can tolerate some feeding. Keep plants well irrigated to compensate for loss of sap due to chinch bug feeding. If your garden is near an uncultivated area with a lot of mustard, you might want to consider using row covers or caps to protect vegetable seedlings until migration had ended. Usually the mass migration lasts only one week at most. These insects move predominantly in the cooler mornings or late evenings, so water sprinkling can help reduce movement during these two periods. Creating a water moat around gardens also can reduce insect infestation. Prevent entry into houses by making sure screens on windows and patio doors are intact and sealing up other entryways. Some pest control companies or homeowners will apply a pesticide around the perimeter of the house to keep the bugs out. However, these products have very short residual, meaning they can save you from insects in your yard today but have little effect on those that arrive tomorrow. A better approach is to seal up entryways. If bugs get into houses, vacuum them up. On-pet Flea Treatment Products. New product innovations have made it possible to effectively, conveniently, and safely prevent flea populations from building up on pets. These products are more effective than the traditional insecticide collars, dusts, shampoos, and sprays. The spot-on formulations available from veterinarians or via the Internet are much easier to use than baths or sprays and are more acceptable to the animal and pet owner. A few drops of the spot-on formula applied to the animals shoulder blades move through the animals coat or are absorbed into the animals skin, providing whole-body treatment. These materials kill adult fleas within hours of the flea jumping on the animal. Also, these compounds have lower toxicity to mammals than traditionally used flea-control products containing carbamates such as carbaryl and propoxur and organophosphates such as chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and tetrachlorvinphos, making them safer to use on pets. Generally spot-on formulations can withstand bathing; check the label for specific instructions. There is no literature concerning the effectiveness of over-the-counter spot-on formulations. With increased EPA concerns about adverse effects reported with the use of topical flea control products, it should emphasized that not all products are safe for all animals. Products containing permethrin and amitraz never should be applied to cats. Be sure to read labels carefully. Systemic Oral Treatments. Three flea-control products are internal medications administered as a pill or chewable food. The insect development inhibitor lufenuron (Program) can be given as a pill to dogs or as a food additive for cats once a month to suppress flea populations. It also can be administered as an injection every 6 months. While this compound doesnt kill adult fleas, it does prevent flea reproduction. Administration of nitenpyram (Capstar) provides rapid knockdown of the fleas on the host within 30 minutes. The effects last about 48 hours. A newer product for dogs containing spinosad (Comfortis) also is fast acting, providing protection for 60 days. These oral treatments are especially appropriate for animals that swim or take frequent baths. Flea Collars. Flea collars typically contain the IGRs methoprene and pyriproxyfen and insecticides such as permethrin and tetrachlorvinphos. The collar releases the IGR, which then distributes itself throughout the pets coat affecting eggs and female adult fleas. Very little information has been published concerning the efficacy of collars. Traditional Insecticide Products. Until recently, pet owners had to rely on products containing conventional insecticides (pyrethrins, permethrin, d-limonene, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, carbaryl, and naled) to control fleas on their pets. These products were formulated as soaps, shampoos, powders, dusts, spray-on liquids, and dips. Although many of these products still are available, they arent as effective to use as the on-animal treatments above. Some products arent labeled for cats. Be sure to read all labels carefully. Nonchemical Treatments. Special metal flea combs are available that help effectively remove adult fleas from the coat of pets. Removing fleas can provide comfort to the animal and reduce flea breeding. Combing pets at regular intervals also is a good way to monitor the flea population and help you decide when other control measures might be necessary. Studies have shown that neither Vitamin B1 (thiamine hydrochloride) supplements nor brewers yeast prevents fleas from feeding. Herbal collars and ultrasonic devices arent effective flea repellents either. Indoors. Controlling cat fleas in buildings requires a variety of approaches. Before starting a control program, look through each room to determine areas where larval development occurs. Flea populations are highest in places where dogs or cats regularly sleep. You usually wont find flea larvae in areas of heavy pedestrian traffic or locations that receive exposure to sunlight; they are likely to be present in areas where adult fleas have left dried blood and feces. Sanitation. Thoroughly and regularly clean areas where you find adult fleas, flea larvae, and flea eggs. Vacuum floors, rugs, carpets, upholstered furniture, and crevices around baseboards and cabinets daily or every other day to remove flea eggs, larvae, and adults. Vacuuming is very effective in killing larvae in the carpet, picking up adults, and stimulating preemerged adults to leave their cocoons. Recent studies suggest that destroying the vacuum bags isnt necessary. Launder pet bedding in hot, soapy water at least once a week. Thoroughly clean items you bring into the building, such as used carpets or upholstered furniture, to prevent these from being a source of flea infestation. Insecticides. Several insecticides are registered for controlling fleas indoors. The most effective products also contain the IGR methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Use a hand sprayer or aerosol to apply insecticides directly to infested areas of carpets and furniture. Total release aerosols, or room foggers, dont provide the coverage and long-term effectiveness of direct sprays unless they contain methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Treatments with insecticides other than IGRs often fail to control flea larvae, because the treatment material fails to contact them at the base of carpet fibers where they develop. Spray carpets, pet sleeping areas, carpeted areas beneath furniture, baseboards, windowsills, and other areas harboring adults or larvae. Fleas will continue to emerge for about 2 weeks after treatment, because the spray doesnt kill pupae. Continue to vacuum, and dont treat again for at least several weeks. Outdoors. In California, outdoor flea populations are most prevalent in coastal localities and other places with moderate daytime temperatures and fairly high humidity levels. In Central Valley locations, populations can become very numerous in shaded and protected areas such as sheltered animal enclosures, crawl spaces under buildings where feral animals might sleep, and vegetated areas adjacent to buildings. Infested outdoor locations left untreated can lead to fleas reinfesting your pets. However, treating the pet with any of the preferred pet treatment products listed above normally will prevent reinfestation. Outdoor sprays arent necessary unless you detect significant numbers of adult fleas. One way to do this is to walk around pet resting areas wearing white socks pulled up to the knee. If fleas are present, they will jump onto socks and be readily visible. Products for eliminating adult fleas outdoors are somewhat limited because many field populations of cat fleas are resistant to pyrethroids such as permethrin. Apply sprays directly in locations where pets rest and sleep such as doghouse and kennel areas, beneath decks, and next to the foundation. It is seldom necessary to treat the entire yard or lawn areas. Flea larvae are unlikely to survive in areas with exposure to sunlight or substantial foot traffic.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Two species of skunk are found in California, the spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis) and the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), which is the species most commonly found around homes. Although originally considered members of the weasel family, recent genetic research has placed skunks into their own family Mephitidae. Both skunk species produce an oily, yellow sulfur-alcohol compound that contains sulfuric acid. This pungent liquid is stored in two separate scent glands located on each side of the anus and can be squirted accurately at targets as far as 6 to 10 feet away as a self-defense mechanism. The secretion is acrid enough to cause nausea and can produce severe burning and temporary blindness if it strikes the eyes.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Skunks have a triangular-shaped head and a moderately elongated body with short, muscular legs and long, sharp non-retractable claws. The striped skunk is about the size of an adult house cat, and its fur is mostly black with white on top of the head and neck. In most animals the white extends down the back, usually separating into two white stripes. Spotted skunks are black with white spots or short white streaks. They are smaller than the striped skunk, about half the size of a house cat. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Striped skunks are primarily active at dawn, dusk, and at night but can be active during the daytime, particularly in human-use areas. Spotted skunks rarely venture out during the daytime. Both skunk species consume a highly-varied diet including insects, grubs, earthworms, small rodents, snakes, lizards, frogs, mushrooms, berries and fruit, pet food, and garbage. Skunks will also opportunistically feed on bird eggs, which can result in substantial losses to ground-nesting birds when skunk densities are high. Food items found in their diet will vary seasonally depending on availability. Breeding usually occurs during February and March for the striped skunk; gestation time is about 9 weeks and litters range from 4 to 6 kits. After 2 to 3 months, the kits can be seen following their mother as she makes her nightly rounds in search of food. Skunks are capable of breeding the spring following birth. The average life span of skunks is around 2 to 3.5 years, although they can occasionally live up to 7 years in the wild. Skunks often den in burrows. They will often use abandoned burrows dug by ground squirrels, foxes, or coyotes and will enlarge them if necessary. If dens are scarce, they will readily use brush piles, hollow logs, and culverts. In urban settings, they den under decks, porches, or beneath buildings. If other suitable dens are unavailable, skunks will dig their own dens. Skunks do not hibernate; but in regions with colder weather, they may congregate in communal dens during the winter. Skunks are attracted to residential areas by the availability of food, water, and shelter. They become a nuisance when they live under porches, decks, garden tool sheds, or homes. Their scent is usually not welcome around homes, and they often spray dogs that bark and approach rapidly. They like to feed on ripening berries and fallen fruit and cause other garden problems by digging while in search of grubs and other insects. They often search for food in lawns by digging small pits or cone-shaped depressions that range from 3 to 5 inches across. Like raccoons, they may also damage lawns by rolling back sections of sod in search of insects. Skunks have an excellent sense of smell and good hearing, but they have very poor vision. This poor vision explains why they are often hit by cars when crossing roads. A skunk may not react if a person more than 10 feet away is quiet and standing still or moving slowly. Healthy skunks are mild-tempered animals. They are not aggressive and, given the opportunity, prefer to flee rather than fight. They usually only defend themselves when suddenly frightened, cornered, or harmed. Skunks usually provide a warning before discharging their scent by stamping their forefeet rapidly, hissing, and arching their tail over their back. Skunks prefer not to spray given the time required to replenish their spray supply. Therefore, using caution around skunks should substantially reduce the possibility of being sprayed. Disease concerns occur when skunks take up residence in an urban or suburban setting. In California, skunks are one of the most common carriers of rabies, a viral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected animal. Skunks can also be carriers of other diseases including leptospirosis, listeriosis, canine distemper, canine hepatitis, Q-fever, and tularemia. LEGAL STATUS The California Fish and Game Code classifies skunks as nongame mammals. The owner or tenant of the premises may lethally remove nongame mammals that are injuring or threatening at any time and in any legal manner. Fish and Game regulations prohibit the relocation of skunks and other wildlife without written permission of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The prevalence of rabies in the skunk population is one of several major reasons for denying requests for relocation. For further information on the legal status of skunks, contact the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.',\n",
       "       'damage': '',\n",
       "       'management': 'Because rabies is endemic in the skunk population, some city or county health departments assist in the control of skunks by providing trappers to remove them from residential areas. Some private pest control companies will also trap and remove skunks for a fee. The skunks tendency to spray their musk-laden spray is sufficient to make them unwelcome visitors, especially in close proximity to homes. However, removing a skunk from a property may not offer a permanent solution if nothing is done to deter other skunks from the property. Several actions can be taken to make gardens, yards, and residences less attractive to skunks. Because they are usually active only at low-light hours and at night, many people never see skunks as they travel through neighborhoods or yards. Barking dogs may be the first apparent sign of their presence, and the odor resulting from a skunk/dog confrontation will provide positive evidence. If skunks repeatedly travel through your yard or garden, sooner or later you will detect a faint skunk odor, even if the skunk has not sprayed. As with raccoons, an occasional visit by a skunk or a family of skunks may not be cause for concern; but if these visits become commonplace, some action is probably warranted. During the breeding season, males frequently spray when fighting over females. The presence of these odors in late winter is a signal that skunks might be nearby and that it could be necessary to take appropriate measures to prevent pregnant females from accessing potential nesting sites underneath buildings and other structures. Habitat Modification The most effective way to make your property less attractive to skunks is by reducing access to food, water, and shelter that the animals need. To reduce food sources, fallen fruit and spilled seed from bird feeders should be removed frequently. Garbage cans should have tight-fitting lids, and food items or table scraps should not be placed in compost bins; use hot rather than cold compost method to process organic waste. Food placed outdoors for pets should be removed by nightfall. Intentionally feeding a wild skunk, even when done with good intentions, is a harmful practice. The skunk or its young may become dependent on the unnatural food source and lose their fear of people. This increases the chance that an adult or child may be bitten. Also, the skunk may be trapped or killed when it wanders into another yard where it is not welcome. It is also suggested that the management of grubs and other insects in lawns can reduce food for skunks. In theory, this will deter the animal from further digging. If your lawn is infested with insects or grubs, see Pest Notes: Lawn Insects or contact your local University of California Cooperative Extension office. Potential den sites can be limited by cutting back overgrown shrubbery and by stacking firewood tightly, preferably at least 18 inches above the ground. Remove boards, rocks, and debris lying on the ground, as insects that skunks feed on hide under these objects. Also, control mice and rats so that their numbers do not build up and provide an abundant food source for skunks. Exclusion As with many other vertebrate pests, the best solution for skunk problems beneath porches or buildings is to screen or block them out. Close off all potential entrances or openings under houses, garden tool sheds, mobile homes, porches, and decks with 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth. The advantage of using the small mesh is that it will also exclude rats and house mice if installed correctly. Skunks will work hard to get into a desirable denning space, so take care to make fittings good and tight. If there is soil underneath the potential entrances, bury the wire at least 6 inches to discourage skunks from digging under. Once skunks have made their home beneath a building, the problem is a little more difficult because you have to be sure the animals have left before blocking the opening. One way to determine this is to sprinkle a smooth, 1/8-inch thick layer of flour just in front of the point of entrance to form a tracking patch. Examine the tracking patch soon after dark; the presence of footprints will indicate that the animal has left and the opening can be closed. However, blocking the entrance is more problematic if there are several young left behind. If you are not sure that all the skunks beneath a building have left, a one-way, outward-swinging gate can be fashioned that will allow any remaining skunks to leave but not to re-enter. This gate can be constructed from 1/2-inch mesh hardware cloth hinged at the top of the frame and left loose on the other three sides. It must be larger than the opening so that it can only swing outward. Skunks will push it open to leave but will not be able to push it inward to re-enter. This is ineffective, of course, if the kits are not yet mobile; kits not yet able to walk may have to be removed by other means. The placement of one or more floodlights beneath the building facing outward through the skunks entry point will often assist in driving them away from a location. Trapping Skunks can be caught with an enclosed cage-type, live-catch trap. Plastic box traps are superior to wire traps because they are completely enclosed, thus reducing the risk of getting sprayed while removing the trapped animal from the site. If a wire live trap is used, cover the back end with an old blanket when setting the trap. The blanket serves two purposes. First, it provides shelter for the skunk. Secondly, it allows the trapper to slowly cover the entire trap once the skunk is captured. Skunks are less stressed when in dark environments and thus are less likely to spray. Be careful when placing the blanket on the back end of the trap so that it does not interfere with the trigger mechanism. Once the trap has been completely covered with the blanket, the trap can be relocated to a carbon dioxide gas chamber for euthanasia. If in a remote area, shooting can also be used to euthanize the trapped skunk. However, skunks usually spray when shot, so shooting may not be the best approach. Note that drowning is not an acceptable or legal form of euthanasia. Once euthanized, skunks can be double-bagged and disposed of in the garbage. Traps can be baited with a variety of foods including sardines, canned cat food, tuna, or bacon. Sweeter foods also work (e.g., peanut butter, apples, melon rinds, marshmallows, doughnuts, etc.) and may be less likely to capture cats. Individuals who have no experience trapping skunks should hire a professional wildlife control operator. Professionals have the experience and all the necessary equipment to trap and dispatch the animal. An experienced trapper is also much less apt to be sprayed, an event to be avoided if at all possible. Skunks cannot be relocated without a permit, and because of the potential for rabies it is unlikely the California Department of Fish and Wildlife will issue one. Other Control Methods Burrow fumigants such as gas or smoke cartridges may be used in rural areas if the burrows used by skunks can be located and are not under or near buildings. They are not generally recommended for use in residential areas because of the risk of fire and penetration of the gas into buildings. These cartridges are ignited and pushed into the skunks burrow. The burrow is then sealed off with soil and packed tightly to prevent the toxic and asphyxiating smoke from escaping. Follow the product instructions carefully. In rural areas, where firearms can be used and it is safe to do so, skunks may be shot. Since they may spray in the process, be selective in the location chosen for this control method. There are no registered toxicants for poisoning skunks. Poison baits sold for the control of rodents should never be used in an attempt to remove skunks. The penalty for such pesticide misuse can be substantial, and illegal poisoning usually comes to light as a result of the accidental poisoning of someones pet. A few commercial products are available for repelling skunks, but unfortunately they are not very effective. A rag soaked with ordinary household ammonia has been used with some reported success as a home remedy repellent for driving skunks from beneath buildings. However, ammonia and other repellents with a strong odor should not be placed under an occupied building since fumes can enter the interior space, especially if air is drawn from beneath the building by a furnace or climate control system. Odor Removal There are several options for odor removal. The chemical neutroleum-alpha is one of the most useful neutralizers for removing the unpleasant skunk scent on furniture or in buildings, but this material and products containing it are not readily available. There are also other commercial products sold for neutralizing or masking skunk odor. If you cannot find such products easily, contact a professional wildlife control operator who may be able to provide neutroleum-alpha or can tell you where it can be purchased. Do not use neutroleum-alpha on pets or people. If your dog or cat has confronted a skunk, call your veterinarian to determine current recommendations for washing the animal to get rid of skunk odor. A home remedy formulation reported by some to be effective is as follows: 1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide 1/4 cup baking soda and 1 teaspoon liquid soap. Once the hydrogen peroxide is mixed with the baking soda the mixture is unstable and generates oxygen and cannot be bottled or stored. Apparently, oxidation changes the chemical composition of skunk scent so that it no longer smells. When the fresh mixture is applied to items contaminated by skunk odor, the smell diminishes quickly. Any leftover mixture should be diluted several fold with water and poured down the drain. Hydrogen peroxide mixtures can be used safely on pets and people as well as on clothing and furniture. However, care should be taken to keep the mixture out of the eyes. Rinse pets thoroughly with water after treatment. Skunk Bites Rabies, an infectious disease caused by a virus, is found in the saliva of infected animals. It affects only mammals and is transmitted most commonly by a bite. People can survive the bite of a rabid animal but only if medical attention is received in time. A physician should promptly attend to ALL skunk bites, no matter how minor; and the local health department should be notified of the incident. Skunks that seem tame or listless and wander about in an unusual manner during daylight hours should be treated with great caution because this behavior is symptomatic of rabies. Also, if they exhibit no fear of people or pets and show some aggressive behavior, chances are quite high that they are rabid. If you live in an area where skunks occur, be sure your dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated against rabies. Some dogs will confront skunks whenever they get an opportunity. Even though they suffer when they get sprayed, some dogs never learn. People with a high risk of occupational exposure to rabies should also consult with their physician about the possible benefit of being vaccinated.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Springtails (order Collembola) are very small, jumping insects that sometimes alarm homeowners by appearing in large numbers in moist indoor areas such as kitchen sinks, bathtubs, and in the soil of houseplants. They may also be found outdoors in swimming pools, moist landscaped areas or vegetable gardens, and on the surface of mud puddles. They usually appear in the spring and early summer, but can be found year-round in moist environments. Because they jump when disturbed, springtails are sometimes confused with fleas. However, springtails do not bite humans or pets, nor do they spread disease or damage household furnishings. They are mainly a nuisance by their presence.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Springtails are minute, wingless insects about 1/16 inch long. They lay their round eggs in small groups in moist soil, especially where organic matter is abundant. The immature stage is usually whitish, and adults tend to be whitish, bluish, or dark gray to black. The immature stage differs from the adult stage only in size and color. Springtails get their name from the ability to jump up to several inches high by means of a tail-like mechanism (furcula) tucked under the abdomen. When disturbed, this appendage functions as a spring, propelling them into the air away from the danger. HABITAT Springtails live in soil, especially soil amended with compost, in leaf litter and organic mulches, and under bark or decaying wood. They feed on decaying plant material, fungi, molds, or algae. They are also found on the surface of stagnant water or on sidewalks that border flower beds or swimming pools. Mushroom houses and greenhouses also provide the damp environment required for their development. When their environment outdoors becomes dry, springtails search for moisture. They may invade homes or move to more favorable outdoor areas such as areas near swimming pools. They enter homes through window screens, open doors, vent pipes, or in potted plants. They may be attracted to light, entering through windows or under doors. After a hot day, they may congregate on the side of a building in tremendous numbers, increasing the chance of indoor infestation. After entering a house, they crawl in search of moisture, and are often trapped in sinks, washbasins, and bathtubs. They may also occur around floor drains, in damp basements, crawl spaces, and wall voids. They soon die after entering a home unless they find moisture.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Most springtails are harmless scavengers, feeding mainly on decaying organic matter. Some species may damage plants by chewing on the roots and leaves of seedlings. The seedlings may appear wilted and may die if damaged when young. Damage occurs as minute, rounded pits on young leaves or roots, or as irregular holes in thin leaves. Mature plants are not significantly injured. Springtails rarely cause enough damage to plants to warrant control measures. Springtails can become a nuisance around swimming pools when they fall in and drown in large numbers, often coating the pool surface. Although unsightly in the pool, they can be safely removed without cause for concern. Springtails will not bite or otherwise harm people or pets. Their large populations can also make them a nuisance in homes, greenhouses, and other locations where there is a source of moisture. Their continued presence indoors is an indicator of moisture.',\n",
       "       'management': 'The key to managing springtails is to reduce moisture and excess organic matter in gardens, plant pots, and around building foundations. Also screen or caulk cracks that provide entryways for springtails into homes. Pesticides should not be necessary and wont provide long-term control by themselves. Environmental Modification Outside the house, eliminate breeding sites by removing excessive mulch and moist leaves around the foundation. Low, moist places near the house or in the crawl space of the building should be dried out. Do not overwater mulched landscape plants, and let the soil dry slightly between waterings. Where springtails have been a problem in vegetable gardens, provide good drainage, reduce irrigation, and reduce application of organic amendments. Inside the home, springtails can be controlled by airing out and drying infested areas. The use of a fan can speed up the process. Water leaks or other sources of excess moisture should be repaired. Springtails in indoor potted plants can be controlled by avoiding overwatering and by allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Do not allow drain water to stand in saucers between waterings. In sinks and bathtubs, simply wash the insects down the drain. Never pour or spray insecticides down the drains. Exclusion and Sanitation Springtails are attracted to light and are so small that they can enter houses through cracks and crevices such as around doors, utility pipes, or window screens. Repair torn screens and close up places where the springtails can enter the house, such as spaces under doors and around windows and attic or basement vents. Use caulk, weather stripping, fine-mesh screen, steel wool, or expandable foam as appropriate. Springtails that enter the home may be controlled by sweeping or vacuuming. Repeat as needed. Swimming Pools Springtails in the pool will be removed by normal pool filtering or can be manually removed using a pool skimmer. Limiting lush vegetation and mulch around the edge of the pool may reduce recurring problems. Chemical Control Insecticide sprays are generally not recommended for springtail management. They are often no more effective than vacuuming, and repeated applications may be required. At best, pesticides will provide only temporary relief if the conditions favorable for springtail development are not corrected. Pyrethroid insecticides are available for treating foundation walls around the perimeter of buildings. If required, these applications are best done by a professional. Special care must be taken to avoid run-off of pesticides from walls and foundations into storm drains, because they lead directly into creeks and rivers.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Fungus gnats are small flies that infest soil, potting mix, other container media, and other sources of organic decomposition. Their larvae primarily feed on fungi and organic matter in soil, but also chew roots and can be a problem in greenhouses, nurseries, potted plants and interior plantscapes. Adult fungus gnats may emerge from houseplants indoors and become a nuisance.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Fungus gnats (Orfelia and Bradysia species), also called darkwinged fungus gnats (Sciaridae), are dark, delicate-looking flies similar in appearance to mosquitoes. Adult fungus gnats have slender legs with segmented antennae that are longer than their head. Their long antennae distinguish them from the more robust shore flies, which are also found in greenhouses, associated with algae and decomposing organic matter, but have short bristle-like antennae. Although a few species are up to 12 inch long, fungus gnat adults commonly are about 116 to 18 inch long. Wings are light gray to clear, and the common Bradysia species have a Y-shaped wing vein. Because adult fungus gnats are attracted to light, you first might notice these pests flying near windows indoors. However, in comparison with more active species such as the common housefly (Musca domestica), fungus gnats are relatively weak fliers and usually dont move around much indoors. Fungus gnats often remain near potted plants and run across (or rest on) growing media, foliage, compost, and wet mulch piles. Females lay tiny eggs in moist organic debris or potting soil. Larvae have a shiny black head and an elongated, whitish-to-clear, legless body. They eat organic mulch, leaf mold, grass clippings, compost, root hairs, and fungi. If conditions are especially moist and fungus gnats are abundant, larvae can leave slime trails on the surface of media that look like trails from small snails or slugs. Fungus gnats develop through four stages egg, larva (with four larval stages or instars), pupa, and adult. The tiny eggs and oblong pupae occur in damp organic media where females lay eggs and larvae feed. At 75F, eggs hatch in about 3 days, the larvae take approximately 10 days to develop into pupae, and about 4 days later the adults emerge. A generation of fungus gnats (from female to female) can be produced in about 17 days depending upon temperature. The warmer it is, the faster they will develop and the more generations will be produced in a year. Fungus gnats have many overlapping generations each year. Outdoors, they are most common during winter and spring in interior areas of California, when water is more available and cooler temperatures prevail. They can occur during any time of the year in moist coastal regions and indoors.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Adult fungus gnats dont damage plants or bite people; their presence is primarily considered a nuisance. Larvae, however, when present in large numbers, can damage roots and stunt plant growth, particularly in seedlings and young plants. Significant root damage and even plant death have been observed in interior plantscapes and in houseplants when high populations were associated with moist, organically-rich soil. Thus, a houseplant that is wilting may not indicate a lack of water, but rather root damage by fungus gnat larvae or (more commonly) other causes of unhealthy roots. However, too much or too little water, root decay fungi, and improper soil conditions (e.g., poor drainage, or waterlogging) are much more common causes of wilted plants. Serious fungus gnat damage is more common in greenhouses, nurseries, and sod farms. Although larvae also feed on plant roots outdoors, they dont usually cause serious damage.',\n",
       "       'management': 'Most of the fungus gnats life is spent as a larva and pupa in organic matter or soil, so the most effective control methods target these immature stages rather than attempting to directly control the mobile, short-lived adults. Physical and cultural management tacticsprimarily the reductions of excess moisture and organic debrisare key to reducing fungus gnat problems. Commercially-available and naturally-occurring biological control agents can also control this pest. Insecticides are considered an important control option in some commercial plant production but generally arent recommended for fungus gnat management in and around the home. Monitoring Visual inspection for adults usually is adequate for determining whether a problem exists. You will see adults resting on plants, soil, windows, or walls, or you might see them in flight. Besides looking for adults, check plant pots for excessively moist conditions and organic debris where larvae feed. Yellow sticky traps can be used to trap adults. Chunks of raw potato placed in pots with the cut sides down (not the peels) are sometimes used to monitor for larvae. Water and Soil Management Because fungus gnats thrive in moist conditions, especially where there is an abundance of decaying vegetation and fungi, avoid overwatering and provide good drainage. Allow the surface of container soil to dry between waterings. Clean up standing water, and eliminate any plumbing or irrigation system leaks. Moist and decomposing grass clippings, compost, organic fertilizers, and mulches are also favorite breeding spots. Avoid using incompletely-composted organic matter in potting media unless it is pasteurized first, because it will often be infested with fungus gnats. Improve the drainage of the potting mix (e.g., increase the proportion of perlite or sand in the mix). Minimize organic debris around buildings and crops. Avoid fertilizing with excessive amounts of manure, blood meal, or similar organic materials. Screen and caulk leaky windows and doors to help prevent pests from coming indoors. If you have infested plants, dont move them to new areas where flies can emerge to infest other pots. In some cases you may wish to toss out severely infested plants. Purchase and use only pasteurized container mix or potting mix. Commercial growers often treat potting soil with heat or steam before using it; this will kill flies and the algae and microorganisms they feed on. Home gardeners can solarize soil: Moisten it. Place it in a bag of transparent plastic or black plastic. Make the pile no deeper than about 8 inches. Place the bagged soil on a slightly elevated surface, such as a pallet in a sunny location, for about 4 to 6 weeks. See the Pest Note: Soil Solarization for details. Store pasteurized potting soil off the ground and in closed containers to prevent it from becoming infested before use. Trapping In home situations where fungus gnat adults are a nuisance, it may be possible to reduce the problem by using sticky traps available at retail nursery and garden centers. Yellow sticky traps can be cut into smaller squares, attached to wooden skewers or sticks and placed in pots to trap adults. Also, raw potato chunks placed in the soil are very attractive to fungus gnat larvae. These may be used not only to check pots for larvae but also to trap them away from plant roots. After a few days in a pot, remove infested chunks, dispose of them, and replace with fresh ones. Biological Control Three commercially available biological control agents can be purchased to control fungus gnats in pots or container media (Table 1). These include Steinernema nematodes, Hypoaspis predatory mites, and the biological insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti). Several Bti products (Mosquito Bits, Gnatrol) are readily available in retail nurseries and garden centers, so these products may be the most convenient for home gardeners to use. Bti does not reproduce or persist indoors, so infestations in potting media might require repeated applications at about five-day intervals to provide control. Nematodes and Hypoaspis mites must be mail-ordered and are live and perishable products, requiring immediate application. Nematodes can provide relatively long-term control of fungus gnat larvae, and they can be self-reproducing after several inoculative applications to establish their populations. Steinernema feltiae is more effective against fungus gnats than other commercially available nematode species. Mix Bti or nematodes with water, and apply as a soil drench, or spray onto media using a hand-pump spray bottle or other spray equipment, following label directions. Several natural enemies help to manage fungus gnat populations in outdoor systems, such as landscapes and gardens, and indoors in greenhouses and conservatories, including the predatory hunter flies, Coenosia spp. These flies catch and consume adult fungus gnats in mid-air, and prey on fungus gnat larvae in soil while developing as larvae themselves. Conserve these and other natural enemies by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticide applications. Table 1. Commercially Available Biological Pesticides and Natural Enemies for Controlling Fungus Gnat Larvae. Biological Comments Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti) (Gnatrol) A naturally occurring, spore-forming bacterium produced commercially by fermentation. Bti applied at labeled rates provides temporary control and is toxic only to fly larvae, such as mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. Repeat applications commonly are needed for long-term control. This Bt is a different subspecies from that applied to foliage to control caterpillars. Bt labeled for caterpillars is not effective against fly larvae. Hypoaspis (= Geolaelaps or Stratiolaelaps) miles A light-brownish predaceous mite adapted to feeding in the upper layers of moist soil. Preys on fungus gnat larvae and pupae, thrips pupae, springtails, and other tiny invertebrates. Commercial mites commonly are shipped in a shaker-type container used to apply them. Recommended rates in commercial nurseries are about 1/2 to several dozen mites per container or square foot of media. Make applications before pests become abundant. Hypoaspis probably wont perform very well in individual houseplants and probably isnt a good choice for use in homes. Steinernema feltiae This nematode is effective when temperatures are between 60 to 90F and conditions are moist. You can apply it as a soil drench and to media using conventional spray equipment. Nematodes reproduce and actively search for hosts, so under moist conditions they can provide season-long control after several initial applications to establish populations. These materials are essentially nontoxic to people and are compatible for application in combination. Bt is available from many well-stocked nurseries and garden supply stores. Predaceous mites, Bti, and nematodes, are commercially available through mail order from special suppliers. Chemical Control Insecticides are rarely warranted to control these flies in and around homes. However, if you do apply an insecticide for fungus gnats, consider using Bti or Steinernema feltiae nematodes to control the larvae; see the section Biological Control for more information. If Bti or nematodes arent available and high populations are intolerable, pyrethrins or a pyrethroid insecticide may provide temporary, fast-acting control. Spray the surface of potting soil and plant parts where adults typically rest. Do not aerially fog indoors or attempt to spray adult gnats in flight. Be sure the product is labeled for your particular use (e.g., for \"house plants\") and read and follow the product\\'s directions. Pyrethrins have low toxicity to people and pets and are the active ingredients in the botanical pyrethrum, which is derived from flowers of certain chrysanthemums. Many products include a petroleum-derived synergist (piperonyl butoxide, or PBO) to increase pyrethrum effectiveness. Pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, permethrin) are synthesized from petroleum to be chemically similar to pyrethrins; they often are more effective and persistent but are more toxic to beneficial insects. When using these products on houseplants or interiorscape containers, if possible move plants outdoors for treatment as a precaution, and wait about a day after applying the chemical before bringing them back inside. For information on managing fungus gnats in commercial flower, nursery or greenhouse operations, see the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines: Floriculture and Ornamental Nurseries and the book Integrated Pest Management for Floriculture and Nurseries.'},\n",

Spiders that might injure peoplefor example, black widowsgenerally spend most of their time hidden under furniture or boxes, or in woodpiles, corners, or crevices. The spiders commonly seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Spiders resemble insects and sometimes are confused with them, but they are arachnids, not insects. Spiders have eight legs and two body partsa head region (cephalothorax) and an abdomen. They lack wings and antennae. Although spiders often are found on plants, they eat mainly insects, other spiders, and related arthropods, not plants. Most spiders have toxic venom, which they use to kill their prey. However, only those spiders whose venom typically causes a serious reaction in humans are called poisonous spiders. See the sidebar: Spider Bites. Table 1. Common Spider Families in North America. Agelenidae, funnel weavers or grass spiders Sit-and-wait predators feed during the day and night on the ground in most types of vegetation, including low-growing plants and trees. Spin funnel-shaped webs, often with several-inch-wide, flat extension covering plants or soil. The spider waits in the hole of its web. When it detects vibrations from an insect that flew or walked into the web, the spider runs out, captures and bites the prey, then carries it back into the funnel to be eaten. Webs on low vegetation become conspicuous in morning light after collecting dew. Funnel weavers have six or eight eyes, all about the same size, arranged in two rows. About 300 species in North America. Araneidae, orb weavers or garden spiders Feed on insects that fly, fall, or are blown into web. Elaborate silken webs are spun in concentric circles. Spiderlings often make symmetrical webs; mature spiders may spin a more specialized design that is helpful in identifying certain species. The spider rests at the center of its web or hides in a shelter near the edge, waiting for prey to become entangled. Orb weavers generally have poor vision and rely on web vibrations to locate and identify prey. About 200 species in North America. Clubionidae (including Corinnidae), sac spiders or twoclawed hunting spiders Stalk and capture prey that is walking or resting on surfaces. They spin silken tubes or sacs under bark, among leaves, and in low plants or on the ground, where they hide during the day or retreat after hunting. Commonly are nocturnal, medium-sized, pale spiders with few markings. About 200 species in North America. Linyphiidae (=Microphantidae), dwarf spiders Prey on insects that fall, walk, or land in their web. Diurnal (day active) spiders occurring in the plant canopy and among litter on the ground. They produce sheetlike webs on the surface of plants or soil and are common in some field and vegetable crops. Most are relatively small. Several hundred species in North America. Lycosidae, wolf spiders Prey on insects that are walking or resting on the ground. Actively hunt in the open during the day and night, often observed on the ground in litter and on low vegetation. Can occur in burrows and under debris on soil. Instead of spinning webs to catch prey, make a small, thick web where they rest. Have a distinctive pattern of eyes: four small eyes in front in a straight row, one middle pair of larger eyes, and one rear pair of widely spaced eyes on top of the head. They have long hairy legs. They are usually black and white or strongly contrasting light and dark, which can make them difficult to discern unless they are moving. About 200 species in North America. Oxyopidae, lynx spiders Stalk and capture resting or walking insects. Active hunters with good vision. Most have spiny legs and a brightly colored body that tapers sharply toward the rear. They have four pairs of eyes grouped in a hexagon. About 2 dozen known species in North America. Salticidae, jumping spiders Day-active hunters in plants or on the ground. They make no web; instead they stalk and pounce on prey by jumping distances many times their body length. Jumping spiders have a distinctive pattern of eyes in three rows: the first row of four eyes, with large and distinctive middle eyes; a second row of two very small to minute eyes; and a third row of two medium sized eyes. They usually have an iridescent, metallic-colored abdomen and black carapace. About 300 species in North America. Theridiidae, cobweb, cobweb weaver, or combfooted spiders Feed on insects that walk or fly into their webs. Almost always found hanging upside down by their claws in irregularly spun, sticky webs, waiting for prey. The spider is usually concealed in a corner of the web, in a silken tent, or behind debris. This group includes the black widow spider, which produces relatively thick silk that feels rough and sticky. They generally have a soft, round, bulbous abdomen and slender legs without spines. Over 200 species in North America. Thomisidae, crab spiders or flower spiders Stalk and capture insects walking or resting on surfaces. Diurnal hunters that do not spin webs. Front two pairs of legs are enlarged and extend beyond the side of their flattened body, making them look like tiny crabs. Their small eyes occur in two slightly curved rows, with the top row often much wider than the lower row. Over 200 species in North America. Black Widow Spider The black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most common harmful spider in California. Venom from its bite can cause reactions ranging from mild to painful and serious, but death is very unlikely and many symptoms can be alleviated if medical treatment is obtained. Anyone bitten by this spider should remain calm and promptly seek medical advice; it is helpful if the offending spider can be caught and saved for identification. The typical adult female black widow has a shiny black body, slender black legs, and a red or orange mark in the shape of an hourglass on the underside of the large, round abdomen. The body, excluding legs, is 5/16 to 5/8 inch long. Only the larger immature female and adult female spiders are able to bite through a persons skin and inject enough venom to cause a painful reaction. The adult male black widow is one-half to two-thirds the length of the female, has a small abdomen, and is seldom noticed. The male black widow does possess venom, but its fangs are too small to break human skin. The top side of its abdomen is olive-greenish gray with a pattern of cream-colored areas and one light-colored band going lengthwise down the middle. The hourglass mark on the underside of the abdomen typically is yellow or yellow-orange and broad waisted. The legs are banded with alternating light and dark areas. Contrary to popular belief, the female black widow rarely eats the male after mating but may do so if hungry. Like males, young female black widow spiders are patterned on the top side. In the early stages they greatly resemble males but gradually acquire the typical female coloration with each shedding of the skin. In intermediate stages they have tan or cream-colored, olive-gray, and orange markings on the top side of the abdomen, a yellowish orange hourglass mark on the underside, and banded legs. Webs and Egg Sacs The web of the black widow is an irregular, tough-stranded, sticky cobweb mesh in which the spider hangs with its underside up. During the day it often hides under an object at the edge of the web or stays in a silken retreat in the center. The black widow may rush out of its hiding place when the web is disturbed, especially if egg sacs are present. The egg sacs are mostly spherical, about 1/2 inch long and 5/8 inch in diameter, creamy yellow to light tan in color, opaque, and tough and paperlike on the surface. A female may produce several egg sacs. Tiny, young black widows, which are nearly white in color, disperse to new locations by ballooning and infest new areas. Spider Bites Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-222-1222). Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, apply an antiseptic to prevent infection, and use ice or ice water to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary, try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist. Where the Spiders Live. Black widow spiders occur in most parts of California. They and their associated webs usually are found in dark, dry, sheltered, relatively undisturbed places such as among piles of wood, rubbish, or stones; in culverts, hollow stumps, and old animal burrows; in garages, sheds, barns, crawl spaces, utility meter boxes, and outhouses; and sometimes among plants. People are most likely to be bitten when they disturb the spider while they are cleaning out or picking up items in such places. A sensible precaution is to always wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt when working in areas that have been undisturbed for a time and where there are good hiding places for spiders. Effects of the Bite. The symptoms of a black widow bite are largely internal; little more than local redness and swelling may develop at the bite site. The internal effects may range from mild to severe. Pain tends to spread from the bite to other parts of the body and muscular spasms may develop. In severe cases the abdominal muscles may become quite rigid. Other effects can include profuse sweating, fever, increased blood pressure, difficulty breathing and speaking, restlessness, and nausea. Typically, the pain and other symptoms reach a maximum within a day of the bite, then gradually subside over the next 2 to 3 days. Most people who are bitten spend a few hours under observation by a physician but do not develop symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Small children, the elderly, and persons with health problems are likely to suffer some of the more severe consequences of the bite. Black widow bites are fairly common in California. Yellow Sac Spider The common, house-dwelling agrarian sac or yellow sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum, is a small spider that spins a silken sac web in the corners of ceilings and walls, and behind shelves and pictures; it is also commonly found outdoors in shrubbery. This spider is light yellow and has a slightly darker stripe on the upper middle of the abdomen. The eight eyes of this spider are all about equal in size and arranged in two horizontal rows. Yellow sac spiders can be seen running on walls and ceilings at night and quickly drop to the floor to escape if they are disturbed. Bites usually occur when the spider becomes trapped against a persons skin in clothing or bedding. It is estimated that sac spiders are responsible for more bites on people than any other spider. Typical symptoms of a bite include initial pain, redness, and sometimes swelling. Recluse Spiders Recluse spiders of the genus Loxosceles include the well-known brown recluse spider, L. reclusa, which does not occur in California. While the brown recluse has occasionally been brought into California in household furnishings, firewood, and motor vehicles, it does not reside in the state. However, populations of another recluse spider, the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta), were found in Los Angeles County in the late 1960s. In its native Chile it is known to have a bite that is toxic to humans. The native recluse spider of California (L. deserta) is found in the desert regions of southern California and neighboring states. Its bite can cause problems, but it is not as toxic as that of the Chilean recluse. In any case, bites from the desert recluse are rare and no bites from the Chilean recluse have ever been recorded in California despite its presence in heavily populated urban areas. Both the native desert recluse spider and the Chilean recluse spider occur principally in the drier areas of southern California. Recluse spiders can have a violin-shaped mark (with the neck of the violin pointing backward) on the top side of the head region (cephalothorax). However, the mark is not always distinct, so it should not be used as an identifying character. A unique feature of recluse spiders is their six eyes, arranged in pairs in a semicircle, which can be seen with the use of a good hand lens. Most other spiders have eight eyes. All recluse spiders make large, irregular, flattened, cobweb-type webs with thick strands extending in all directions. These spiders avoid light, are active at night, and tend to build their webs in out-of-the-way places. Chilean recluse spiders may be found indoors in boxes, in corners, behind pictures, in old clothing hanging undisturbed, and in other similar places. Desert recluse spiders appear outdoors where they may be found under rocks or wood. More detailed information on these spiders is available in Pest Notes: Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders . Other Spiders In addition to the species mentioned above, there are only a few other species of spiders in California that may on occasion bite humans. (Remember, if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician). One kind of red and black jumping spider, Phidippus johnsoni, may bite if it is disturbed, but the bites are usually not serious. The female spiders are black with red on the top side of the abdomen whereas the males are all red. These spiders range in size from 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Tarantulas are long-lived spiders that occupy burrows in the ground during the day but often come out at night to hunt insects near the burrow. They commonly are feared because of their large size and hairy appearance. Some poisonous tarantulas occur in tropical parts of the world, but the bites of California tarantulas are not likely to be seriousat worst, they are similar to a bee sting. However, because of the variety of tarantulas sold in the pet trade industry, there is a spectrum of venom potencies among these creatures. These spiders ranges from 1 to 2 inches in body size. The hobo spider, Tegenaria agrestis, also called the aggressive house spider, is a common spider in the Pacific Northwest. It builds funnel-shaped webs in dark, moist areas such as basements, window wells, wood piles, and around the perimeter of homes. It is a large (1 to 13/4 inch, including legs), fast-running brown spider with a herringbone or multiple chevron pattern on the top of the abdomen. The hobo spider has not been documented in California, but it has expanded its range from the Pacific Northwest to northern Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Although it has been stated as being a poisonous spider, recent research is challenging the original data that elevated this spider to medical importance. See Pest Notes: Hobo Spiders . One spider frequently found indoors is the common house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, which makes a cobweb in corners of rooms, in windows, and in similar places. Another is the marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, which was introduced into the state in the 1970s and has since displaced the once common longbodied cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides, a long-legged spider that resembles a daddy-longlegs. These spiders are only marginally capable of biting humans because their fangs are too short to pierce peoples skin; they primarily cause problems by producing messy cobwebs. Various kinds of small hunting spiders may wander indoors and occasionally, rather large, hunting-type spiders are discovered in homes or garages. Often these are fully grown wolf spider or tarantula males that have reached maturity and are searching for females. When these spiders are wandering, one or more may accidentally get indoors. New houses and other structures in developments may be invaded by wolf spiders that have lost their usual outdoor living places. The more insects that exist inside a building, the more likely it is to have spiders living there. Usually spiders are most abundant in fall following the first few rains of the season. Immature and adult female burrow-living spiders sometimes wander for a time during the rainy season if they have had to abandon wet burrows.',\n",

       "       'management': 'Spiders may enter houses and other structures through cracks and other openings. They also may be carried in on items like plants, firewood, and boxes. To prevent spiders from coming indoors, seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors. Good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they prey upon. Regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, basements, and other seldom used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive the tumbling process through the hose. Indoors, a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider because occupied spider webs are maintained for cleanliness to enhance prey capture. Individual spiders can also be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. They can then be released outdoors. Watch this video to learn more: How to catch a spider. In indoor storage areas, place boxes off the floor and away from walls, whenever possible, to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders. Sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within. Clean up clutter in garages, sheds, basements, and other storage areas. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Outdoors, eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash, leaf litter, heavy vegetation, and other accumulations of materials. Trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attracts spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Chemical Control: Insecticides will not provide long-term control and should not generally be used against spiders outdoors. Typically, controlling spiders with pesticides is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control, including pyrethrins and pyrethroids (synthetic versions of pyrethrins) such as resmethrin, allethrin, or combinations of these products. Control by spraying is only temporary unless accompanied by housekeeping. It is just as easy and much less toxic to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe or to vacuum it up. Sticky traps offer a noninsecticidal way to remove spiders from your home as long as you can place the traps where pets and children cant tamper with them. Sorptive dusts containing amorphous silica gel (silica aerogel) and pyrethrins, which can be applied by professional pest control applicators only, may be useful in certain indoor situations. Sorptive dust particles affect the outer covering of spiders (and also insects) that have crawled over a treated surface, causing them to dry out and die. When applied as a dustlike film and left in place, a sorptive dust provides permanent protection against spiders. The dust is most safely and effectively used in cracks and crevices and in attics, wall voids, and other enclosed or unused places. SPIDER BITES: Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically, the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-876-4766 or 1-800-8-POISON). One must also keep in mind that although it is impossible to be certain, people and their physicians often blame spiders as the cause of skin lesions with no proof of spider involvement when there are many similar-appearing, non-spider maladies; therefore, care must be exerted in the diagnostic process. Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, and use ice, ice water or cold compresses to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'There are two species of widow spiders in California, the western black widow and the brown widow. Both are in the genus Latrodectus and are characterized by a similar body shape, reclusive habit, and irregular cobwebs. The western black widow, a native species, is widespread, and is the spider posing the greatest potential envenomation threat to humans in the western United States. It is well known in many localities, and nonprofessionals can identify it easily. In the first decade of the 21st century, the non-native brown widow became established in southern California. Although it isn\\'t nearly as dangerous as the black widow, it causes alarm because of the reputation of its relative. BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS Several species of black widow are common in North America, but in the western United States the only species present is the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus. Its habitat ranges from British Columbia and Alberta to Mexico and throughout the Rocky Mountains to the western portions of the Great Plains. In California, it is a common desert spider that can survive very hot, dry conditions. However, black widows also can be found in mountainous terrain above 5,000-foot elevation in Southern California, where snow covers the ground every winter. Outside California, western black widows are common in urban Colorado, in central and eastern Washington state, and in southern British Columbia. Because the holes, cracks, crevices, trash, and clutter associated with human structures provide ideal habitat for the western black widow, these spiders are often very common around homes, barns, outbuildings, and rock walls. In such supportive habitats, mature females can be found every few feet and sometimes within inches of each other. Identification A mature female western black widow spider is about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in body length, and has a rounded abdomen and very characteristic coloration. She is shiny jet black all over her body and legs, except for a red pattern on the underside of the abdomen, which looks, in perfect specimens, like an hourglass. Some specimens have a brownish or plum-colored tinge, but usually these are females that are so well fed that the black-pigmented abdomen has been stretched until it looks brown instead of black. The red hourglass varies in appearance; it can be two perfect triangles with points merged to make a perfect hourglass, two triangles separated by a space, a triangle and a small bar, minimal or almost imperceptible red coloration, or, on rare occasions, completely absent. The false black widow, which is discussed below, is chocolate brown and never has red coloration, although many people frequently mistake it for a black widow. As easy as it is to identify an adult female black widow, the immatures, looking nothing like the mother, can be difficult to recognize. When black widow spiderlings emerge from their egg sac, they have tan legs and a tan cephalothorax (the body part to which the legs attach), while the abdomen is mostly white with a few black spots. As the spider grows, the background coloration of the abdomen becomes olive-gray or tan; and there is a longitudinal white stripe on the top of the abdomen and diagonal stripes on the flanks, with a small black dot at the uppermost portion of each diagonal stripe. As the spiderlings continue to grow larger, they molt, like all spiders, in order to shed their restrictive exoskeletons. With successive molts in females, the white stripes become thinner, the olive-gray or tan coloration darkens toward black, and eventually the spider acquires its well-known black coloration. Some mature females retain one or two conspicuous, indented white lines on the front surface of the abdomen that look like a corporal\\'s chevrons. In the youngest spiders, the space where the hourglass develops starts off being a whitish shield. As the spider grows and molts several times, the color of this shield turns from white-yellow to orange-red and changes from a shield with a thick middle portion to an hourglass with a thin, tapered middle. In contrast to the female, the male black widow retains the coloration of the juvenile. After it matures, it stops eating and its abdomen shrinks (its only task at this point is to mate). The male still retains one longitudinal abdominal stripe and a set of diagonal flank stripes on each side of the abdomen. The males are much smaller than the females in body length, although sometimes their legs are almost as long as those of the adult female. Egg Sac The egg sac of the western black widow is yellowish and teardrop-shaped, tapered at the top and bulbous at the bottom. The margins of the sac are well defined (as opposed to some spider egg sacs, which look like fluffy cotton balls, making it difficult to determine exactly where the egg sac starts). The egg sac covering is very tough and difficult to rip apart. A female western black widow typically lays about 300 eggs per sac. Because females can store sperm from their only mating, they can produce more than 10 egg sacs without subsequent matings and without a decrease in the number of eggs or a reduction in the percentage of eggs that will successfully hatch into spiderlings. Habitat The western black widow is found in populated areas almost everywhere in California. Although they can be found in homes, black widows typically nest outside, around the home in holes and crevices, and within clutter. In garages, they usually make webs by doors, near vents, and in other places where insects may pass by. Because most people don\\'t tolerate large numbers of insects in their living spaces, widow spiders usually won\\'t find sufficient prey to survive inside homes. Black widows are shy spiders that seek retreats, such as holes between bricks or spaces around pipe penetrations in walls, where they can hide during the day and then come out at night. In natural settings, you can often find them in rodent burrows and crevices in rock faces. The spider makes a web of tangled silk extending from this retreat hole. The web doesn\\'t have a very recognizable pattern, although it does have vertical support threads above and below the central areas where the spider sits while it waits for prey at night. The lower support threads also alert the widow to the presence of a prey item blundering into the web. In most cases, a widow spider will seek a retreat near the ground as the home base for her web, which connects to the retreat, allowing the spider to emerge to catch both flying and crawling prey at night, usually within three feet of the ground. However, some spiders will make a retreat well above ground level, such as in the eave of a house, and then drop down 10 or more feet before building their web. Widow spiders come out at dusk. After making improvements to their existing web, they take up a position in the middle, their underside facing upward, to wait for prey. Any large disturbance of the web that indicates something larger than a prey item causes the spider to quickly move toward the safety of its retreat. The silk of a mature black widow is very strong. If you run your finger through the web of a large spider, the result is an audible ripping sound. Black widow silk is so strong that during World War II, it was used to make crosshairs for gun sights. Medical Aspects Bites from black widow spiders are quite rare, even where these spiders are very common. In the unlikely event of an actual bite from a black widow, the bite itself is painless or may feel like a little pinprick. Almost all medically important black widow bites are from the adult female, which is much larger than the male. The female also has stronger biting muscles and a larger venom reserve. At the site of the bite, there may be a little red mark or red streaking away from the bite. Within an hour, other symptoms may start to appear. Bite victims might suffer from some but not all of the following symptoms: Rigid stomach muscles, which some medical professionals have misdiagnosed as appendicitis Sweating, sometimes of just the bitten body part, such as a bite to the hand that results in only the arm sweating profusely Pain that can be local, radiating, or regional Urine retention Numbness, agitation, fever, and patchy paralysis (less common) Another sign of envenomation is that bite victims will sometimes move or rock back and forth incessantly to try to lessen the pain from the venom injection process. Although these are the most severe manifestations of black widow bites, symptoms most often merely resemble those of the flu. Black widow bites don\\'t cause conspicuous swelling, necrosis, or deterioration of tissue around the bite. As a neurotoxin, the venom of a black widow affects the nerve-muscle junction in the body. Normally, the body\\'s neurons work like a light switch: they make the muscle turn on and then off again so that the muscle can relax and be ready to contract again if needed. The venom causes the muscle to repeatedly contract. It would be like flipping on a light switch and not being able to turn it off again. If bitten, seek medical attention immediately. You can place a cold pack on the bite to relieve the pain. An antivenom for black widow bites is available that works for all species that have been tested worldwide. Response is fast, and bite victims can go from intense pain back to normal in 30 minutes. The antivenom is based on horse serum, so physicians need to monitor for anaphylactic shock. American physicians are somewhat reluctant to use antivenom for this reason and might prefer to have the bite victim simply endure the symptoms, which can be similar to those of a bad flu episode and usually dissipate in a few days. BROWN WIDOW SPIDERS The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is found worldwide in subtropical habitats. It probably originated from Africa, or possibly from South America. In North America, the brown widow was found only in Florida for many decades, where it remains rather common. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the spider began appearing elsewhere, from Texas throughout the Gulf Coast states and up the Atlantic coast into South Carolina. While they were expanding in the southeastern United States, brown widows started being discovered in great numbers in Southern California, where they have caused great concern within the general public. Initial news reports exaggerated the impact of the brown widow. However, unlike that of the black widow, the bite of this spider is not much more toxic to humans than that of other common spiders. Identification Mature female brown widows are smaller than mature female western black widows, being about 3/8\" in body length (10 mm). The normal brown widow spider coloration is a mottled collection of tan, brown, and gray. It has a lengthwise stripe halfway up the back side of the abdomen with two isolated dots in front of it and diagonal stripes on the side, somewhat similar to immature western black widow spiders (see Table 1). However, the usual background coloration of the brown widow is more of a tan, as compared to the western black widow, in which background coloration is more olive-gray. Male brown widows are much smaller [body length: 3/16 inch (4 to 5 mm)] than other widow spiders and therefore might be overlooked or misidentified. There is, however, great variation in brown widow coloration. Spiders can vary from almost white to almost black. When brown widows are very dark, though, this coloration is closer to a flat black than a shiny black like that of a mature black widow female. A mature brown widow female looks very similar to an immature western black widow, thus some skill is needed to identify the two accurately. However, the brown widow egg sac, as described in the next paragraph, is distinctive and a much surer way to confirm the species. Table 1. Features used to distinguish brown widows from immature western black widows. Feature Brown widow Black widow (immature) Black spots on lateral abdominal stripes large, squarish small, elliptical Hourglass bottom half larger top half larger rough margins crisp, straight margins White markings on front of abdomen not continuous continuous Egg Sac The egg sac of the brown widow spider has protuberances of silk all over its surface, resembling a very large pollen grain. The sac is so characteristic that it can be used to verify the presence of brown widows even if the spiders themselves are not seen. Brown widows produce about 130 eggs per egg sac and are able to make 20 or more egg sacs in a lifetime, sometimes multiple sacs within a short time period. Female brown widows can be collected with several simultaneously-developing egg sacs. Habitat The habitat of the brown widow is similar in many respects to that of the black widow. They generally reside in cluttered areas outside, such as woodpiles, but you will also find them in more exposed areas, such as on chain-link fences where black widows normally would not be found. They are also extremely common in the nooks and crannies on the undersides of inexpensive plastic patio furniture. Brown widow spiders make irregular webs of strong silk, similar to those of western black widows. Both black widows and brown widows are almost never found in homes. In garages, black widows are common but brown widows are not. Outside and around the home, both spiders are very common. The brown widow appears to be displacing the black widow in some of its habitats, especially in urban areas. Southern California residents frequently mention that they used to have a few black widows, but now only can find brown widows (and in greater numbers). In a study published in 2012, brown widows outnumbered black widows in urban areas; such as around homes, in parks (especially under playground equipment), in zoos, etc. The same study, however, reported that brown widows were not found in natural areas in southern California (such as in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat) and were rare around agricultural buildings. Brown widows were occasionally found in agricultural crops such as citrus, apple, and avocado trees as well as in corn stalks, bird-of-paradise leaves and other plants, but most of these finds were in vegetation associated with small home gardens rather than large commercial properties. As of 2016, brown widows were well established from Santa Barbara to the San Bernardino area and south to Mexico. Established populations have not yet been found north of the Los Angeles Basin, in the Central Valley, or in the desert areas (which may be inhospitable for them due to the arid climate). Although unsubstantiated reports of brown widows occurring north of the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara region (such as in the San Francisco Bay area) have been made for years, submitted spiders have been immature black widows, Steatoda (false black widow) spiders of several species, or orbweavers. However, it is possible that the brown widow is continuing to expand its range in California. Medical Aspects The bite of the brown widow is much milder than that of the western black widow. In a study in Africa, the most common symptoms in 15 verified bites were that the bite hurt when it happened and that there was burning pain at the bite site. None of these patients developed the typical dynamic symptoms of black widow envenomation. Despite these observations, there is one American record of a verified bite where the patient developed more severe symptoms and required hospitalization. Although its venom is at least as potent as black widow venom (drop for drop, as tested in mice), the brown widow is smaller and likely injects much less venom during a bite. In addition, bites to people are unlikely since brown widows, when disturbed, typically pull their legs close to the body, drop from their web, and play dead. The recent arrival of the brown widow in Southern California is not a cause for alarm. In fact, if the brown widow is indeed displacing the more toxic black widow, there actually might be a reduction in spider bite risk as compared to previous decades. OTHER RELATED SPIDERS False Black Widow The false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, is not a true widow spider; however, it is in the same family, Theridiidae, as widow spiders and can easily be confused with them. It shares the same rounded-abdomen body form and web-making traits. It is slightly smaller than a mature western black widow spider [body length: 3/8 inch (10 mm)], chocolate brown in color, and never has red coloration on its belly. The false black widow is a European immigrant that has become extremely common in Pacific Coast homes from San Diego to British Columbia, with isolated finds in Alaska. Unlike black widows, false black widow spiders thrive indoors, especially in washrooms, inside cupboards and underneath appliances, furniture and cabinets. False black widows make an egg sac that looks like a cotton ball with indistinct margins. Unlike black widow spiders, false black widow spiderlings are dark like their mothers when they emerge. Because they are common in homes, false black widows are more frequently involved in bite incidents than black widow or brown widow spiders. They have mild venom, and bites may cause symptoms similar to those of yellowjacket wasp stings: initial burning pain followed by minor localized swelling around the envenomation site. When black widow antivenom mistakenly has been used on false black widow bites, it appeared to eliminate the venom\\'s effects. Noble False Widow Spider In 2011, Steatoda nobilis was discovered in Southern California. Like the false black widow, this spider is a European native. Mature females can reach 5/8 inch (14 mm) in body length, which is significantly larger than the false black widow. Instead of being uniformly colored on the top surface of the abdomen as is the false black widow, Steatoda nobilis usually has a light tan pattern somewhat resembling a house with two windows and a domed roof. However, in some specimens, only the remnant tip of the \"roof\" is exhibited. There is also a broad, tan band on the front-facing surface of the abdomen. This spider was first found in Ventura County. It is now widespread in coastal San Diego County, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay area. Isolated finds have occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Bites from this species are not considered to be medically significant. There have been two recorded bites from the spider, with minor symptom development, but because of its large size, it has the potential to hurt merely from fang penetration. This spider will probably continue to spread throughout coastal California.',\n",

       "       'management': \"Minimizing sites around the home where spiders may hide, such as clutter, woodpiles, and heavy ground cover, is essential for reducing widow spider populations. However, it is not practical to eliminate these spiders completely. Both widow species will continue to re-infest treated areas. Regularly vacuuming or sweeping windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, and other seldom-used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually don't survive this process. In the garage, keep items such as gardening clothes and gloves in bags closed with zipper-locks or twist ties. Store seasonal items such as sports gear, camping gear, winter clothes or holiday decorations in boxes that can be taped shut and placed off the floor away from walls in order to exclude spiders. When cleaning up clutter in garages and other storage areas, be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Other areas to check carefully include children's toys or playhouses made of molded plastic that have open spaces facing downward where spiders can crawl in. Additional favored habitats of widow spiders include picnic tables, trash can grips, lawn chairs, plant pots with curled lips, and other outdoor objects with sheltered lips or crevices. Be careful that you do not carry spiders indoors on items such as plants, firewood, and boxes. Stack woodpiles away from your house, and never pick up pieces of wood unless you are wearing gloves. Eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping areas near building foundations free of trash, leaf litter, and accumulations of other materials. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attract spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures pointed off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides do not provide long-term control. Because widow spiders are nocturnal, a nonchemical method of eradication is to search for them at night with a flashlight and kill them with a shoe or rolled up newspaper. If you are concerned about wildlife and feel comfortable doing so, you can remove individual spiders from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper underneath to seal off the opening when you lift the jar. Release the spider about 100 feet from your home into a natural area. Brown widows may not survive in natural areas but on the other hand, they are an invasive, non-native pest species and should not be there anyway. One aspect that makes controlling widow spiders difficult is that they, like many spiders, exhibit a behavior called ballooning. When the spiderlings are very small, on warm days when there is an updraft, they climb to the top of a fence post or piece of vegetation, raise their abdomens into the air, and release a small filament of silk. When the updraft currents overtake the forces of gravity, the spiderling is carried into the air to another location. This may only be a few feet away, or it could be miles. Ballooning spiderlings have been captured at 10,000 feet from the ground and 200 miles offshore. Because spiderlings will be dropping down on your property continually, eliminating them will be a task that needs to be done repeatedly throughout the year. Chemical Control Typically, control of spiders using pesticides is difficult. Various insecticides are registered for control of spiders; including pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and combinations of these products. Curiously, most of these registered pesticides are water-based while the silk of spider egg sacs repels water. In a 2016 study, water-based insecticides sprayed on brown widow egg sacs provided no significant effect on the egg contents. However, when petroleum-based products were used, the pesticide was readily carried past the silk outer layer and killed the egg sac contents.\"},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Wild radish is a winter or summer annual, or sometimes a biennial broadleaf. In California both wild radish and radish, Raphanus sativus, are widespread and where they occur together they readily hybridize. The resulting offspring pose a problem for identification to species because of the range of characteristics they exhibit. Wild radish is found throughout California except for deserts, up to 2600 feet (800 m) and radish is found throughout except for deserts, the Great Basin, and some mountain areas, to 3300 feet (1000 m). Both are susceptible to several diseases and pests that damage a variety of crops. These pests include flea beetle, thrips, blackleg of brassicas, and turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus (TYMV). They also attract several beneficial predators of crop pests, as well as bees. Wild radish can be found in agricultural fields and other disturbed sites. Habitat Crop fields, orchards, vineyards, neglected gardens, parks, roadsides, and other disturbed locations. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are kidney to broadly heart shaped, about 2/5 to 4/5 inch (12 cm) long, with a deep notch at the tip and a base that abruptly tapers to a hairless stalk. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. The seedlings resemble mustards in the genus Brassica but are duller green and more roughly textured. Both the first true leaves and a few later leaves have a long football shape, a base that tapers or is deeply lobed once or twice, irregularly round-toothed edges, and attach to the stem on long stalks. Both the first true leaves and later few leaves have a long football shape, a base that tapers or is deeply lobed once or twice, irregularly round-toothed edges, and are attached to the stem with long stalks. Young plant Plants exist as rosettes until the flower stem develops at maturity. Mature plant Mature plants are erect, up to 2 feet (1.2 m) tall, and usually branch in the upper portion. Leaves vary in size and shape, but are usually sparsely covered with stiff, flattened hairs, especially toward the base. Lower leaves range from football to egg shaped, deeply lobed (but sometimes weakly lobed) to deeply divided into leaflets, have irregularly round edges or sharp toothed edges, and are typically 2-1/3 to 8 inches (620 cm) long. Upper leaves are reduced in size, football shaped, toothed, sometimes lobed at the base, and either stalkless or on a short stalk. Flowers Flowers have four petals that are narrowed at the base, are generally 3/5 to 1 inch (15-25 mm) long, and may have dark violet veins. Wild radish flowering takes place from April through July. Flower petals range from white to a faded yellow, or pale purplish pink. Radish flowering takes place from February through July. Flower petals are usually pale purplish-pink and occasionally, white. Hybridized populations usually exhibit many flower colors, from white to purple to pink or light yellow brown with streaks of different colors. Fruits Seedpods are initially fleshy and with time become dry and corky. They are long and narrow, almost straight, roundish in cross-section, with a pointed tip. The pods do not open to release seed. Wild radish: Seedpods are mostly 1-3/5 to 3-1/6 inches (48 cm) long and 1/6 to 1/4 of an inch (46 mm) wide, with a nearly uniform diameter for most of the length, and a beak about 2/5 to 4/5 of an inch (12 cm) long. Dry pods are noticeably constricted between seeds. Radish: Dried seedpods have straight sides or may have slight constrictions between seeds. The diameter is largest below the middle and tapers toward the end of the pod. Seeds Seed are round to egg shaped, from less than 1/10 of an inch up to 1/6 of an inch (24 mm) long and roughly 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) wide. They are brown, reddish brown, or yellowish brown. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Cultivated radish, Raphanus sativus',\n",

Various other insects can cause damage that resembles caterpillar chewing, but these other insects do not produce silk strands or webbing. Other leafroller species may occur on the same plant. Omnivorous leafroller larvae have a brown to cream-colored or greenish-brown body up to 3/5 inch long. Larvae have a black or brown head and prothoracic shield, the area just behind the head and on the top and sides of the first abdominal segment. Through the translucent cuticle (outer covering) the main blood vessel running along the back is often visible as a faint dark stripe. The mounds (tubercles) at the base of the bristles along the top and sides are chalky white. Adults are small, dark-brown moths up to 1/2 inch long with a dark band on the wing and a distinct snout.

Clean up gardens by removing weeds that can be alternate hosts of leafroller larvae. Eliminate plant debris that can harbor pupae. Hand removal of webbed leaves and larvae can help control leafrollers on small plants. Otherwise healthy plants tolerate the loss of some leaves. Low numbers of leafrollers do not warrant insecticide application. A properly timed foliar spray of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad controls leafroller larvae. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Pest Notes: Leafrollers on Ornamental and Fruit Trees'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'The sensation feels like bugs, worms, or mites that are biting, crawling over, or burrowing into, under, or out of your skin. They must be there, because you can feel them, and you are even pretty sure that you can see them. You may also believe that your home or furniture is infested, but you may be the only one who knows they are there. No one seems to think they exist except you. Nothing seems to get rid of them. So whats attacking you? And what if your condition seems to be spreading to other family members or to your friends? What if, after trying every reasonable approach and helpful hint from friends, your problem persists? If this situation sounds familiar, then its time to read the rest of this publication, consider possible causes for your condition, and potentially seek the appropriate type of professional help. WHAT CAN CAUSE ITCHING SENSATIONS? Itching, crawling, or burrowing sensations may be the result of many unrelated medical conditions, including: Diabetes mellitus, Drug abuse, particularly methamphetamines and opioids, Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, Multiple sclerosis, Nerve damage, AIDS/HIV, Hepatitis B, C, Liver disease, Parkinsons Disease, Lupus erythematosus, Peripheral neuropathy, Stress, Alcoholism, Anemia, Autoimmune disease, Carbon monoxide poisoning, Cerebrovascular disease, Cirrhosis of the liver, Dry skin, Mechanical irritants, such as fiberglass filaments and paper dust, Menopause, Niacin overdose, Rheumatoid arthritis, Skin cancers, Vitamin, protein, or other deficiencies in your diet. Aside from a medical illness, there are number of commonly prescribed drugs that are known to have side effects which may result in skin irritation such as chronic itching, crawling, or pinching sensations. To rule out medications as possible causes, it is worthwhile to take a complete list of prescriptions and dosages to your pharmacist to find out if possible side effects or negative drug interactions could be causing problems. Thorough testing, including a complete physical checkup by a perceptive physician, should lead to an accurate diagnosis for most sensations of infestation caused by the metabolic disorders or other medical problems listed above. If samples are required, they should be taken directly by the physician and submitted to the experts. Only a proper diagnosis will lead to the appropriate treatment. If thorough allergy and medical testing result in no answers and a clean bill of health while symptoms continue, it is time to consider the possibility that the sensations you are experiencing are in fact not caused by any arthropod or other parasite. WHAT IF NO PARASITES ARE FOUND? The medical disorder in which a patient has a mistaken belief of being infested by parasites such as mites, lice, fleas, spiders, worms, bacteria, or other organisms is called delusional infestation, delusional parasitosis, or Ekbom syndrome. This belief is based on the very real and disruptive sensations felt in or on the skin, which, regardless of home remedies used and scratching of the itches, never go away. More scratching leads to rashes, open wounds and sores, and possible infections. Failure to obtain relief from over-the-counter or prescribed medications often drives the sufferer to apply unconventional and sometimes highly toxic compounds to the body in a desperate attempt to alleviate symptoms. Skin conditions can worsen or become much more complicated. In some cases the parasites appear to be visible to the afflicted person, but they inevitably cannot be caught. In a desperate attempt to discover the causative agent, some sufferers submit pieces of tissue or bodily fluids to medical or other professionals in an attempt to produce samples of the pests. Such wounds can become serious medical problems. HOW CAN STRESS AFFECT FEELINGS OF INFESTATION? Very often a corollary problem associated with a delusional infestation is stress. Stress often manifests itself in people as a nervous habit or nervous tic, but those conditions usually arent overwhelming. Delusional infestation, however, can become debilitating because it tends to amplify the emotional and physical stress level and the condition worsens, greatly impacting the activities and quality of life. Stress is known to be associated with many health problems in Americans, but stress may also result from numerous life experiences including job-related pressures, personal relationships, divorce, loneliness, financial problems, and loss of friends, relatives, or pets. Reducing or managing stress may coincide with a rapid reduction or elimination of symptoms associated with delusional infestation. Your doctor usually can assist in finding ways to reduce the impact of stress in your daily life. However, when delusional infestation is persistent, your physician may want to prescribe medications to help alleviate symptoms while more permanent solutions are sought. If your physician determines that further counseling is needed, you may be referred to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists may prescribe medicines that can successfully treat this disorder. Delusional infestation is a real affliction, and with professional help it can be medically managed or eliminated altogether. More information on delusional infestation may be obtained from professionals working in county health services offices; from county agricultural commissioners; or from the Bohart Museum of Entomology, University of California, Davis website. What about insects or other pests? Some potential causes of skin irritation include bed bugs, fleas, mites, and mosquitoes. These pests can cause bite marks, swelling, and itching. However, correct and conclusive identification of a specimen by a trained entomologist is needed to confirm that an insect or mite is the cause of the bites or itching.',\n",

       "       'management': 'WHO SHOULD I CALL ABOUT UNEXPLAINED ITCHING? The first person to contact should be your family physician or primary health care provider. Medical professionals are the only individuals who are licensed to diagnose your condition and recommend specific treatments. Dermatologists, in particular, are trained to deal most effectively with disorders of the skin and their causes, including parasites. If a parasite is causing the disorder, most physicians or their technicians can recognize the most common ones if they are present. If necessary, the physician can submit medical specimens to entomologists, parasitologists, or other biologists for verification or identification. These experts not only can identify or rule out various kinds of parasites that may be causing your condition, but they can also provide additional biological information that may greatly assist you and your physician in arriving at a satisfactory diagnosis and treatment. Entomologists are skilled in identifying various life stages of insects or mites and can use the diagnostic keys and scientific references to determine accurate identification. Medical entomologists, in particular, spend their careers working with insects, mites, and ticks that attack people. Parasitologists study these and other groups of organisms such as parasitic worms, protozoans, and other invertebrates that live at the expense of their animal hosts. Initially, you may have tried to solve the problem by consulting nonmedical professionals. However, by foregoing medical advice, you may miss the opportunity to be properly diagnosed, which will only increase the duration of having to suffer with the issue. In some instances, the discomfort is not attributed to arthropods (including insects, mites and spiders) or other internal parasites at all. If you have consulted with any, or perhaps several, of the professionals mentioned above and still no one can pinpoint an offending organism, it is unlikely that all of them are wrong. This would be the time to reassess your situation and look for a cause other than a pest organism.'},\n",

About Pest Notes Publication Glossary Mushrooms, sometimes called toadstools, are the visible reproductive (fruiting) structures of some types of fungi. Although the umbrella-shaped fruiting body is the most common and well known, mushrooms display a great variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Some other fruiting bodies encountered in lawns include puffballs, stinkhorns, and bird's nests, descriptive names that reveal the diversity of forms among mushrooms. But regardless of shape, the purpose of all fruiting bodies is to house and then disseminate spores, the reproductive units of fungi. Many fungi, including most that cause lawn diseases, have very small fruiting bodies that are hardly noticeable, and they don't produce typical mushrooms or obvious fruiting structures. Most fungi in lawns are beneficial, because they decompose organic matter, thereby releasing nutrients that are then available for plant growth. This publication covers mushroom-producing fungi that are lawn management or nuisance problems but don't necessarily cause lawn diseases. Information on fungi and other pathogens that cause turfgrass diseases can be found in the University of California publications UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines: Turfgrass and Pest Notes: Lawn DiseasesPrevention and Management.\",\n",

       "       'development': \"Fungal fruiting structures release tiny spores that are easily carried on air currents to new sites. When spores reach a favorable place to grow, they germinate and send out long thin filaments called hyphae. Hyphae of some fungi decompose wood, fallen leaves, and other organic matter, absorbing a portion as food. Other fungi live in a beneficial association with plants, while others parasitize and cause diseases of plants. A single hypha is too small to be seen without magnification; however, in soil or beneath bark, groups of hyphae sometimes are visible as a mass of white or dark threadlike growth known as mycelium. When mycelium has developed sufficiently, fruiting bodies such as mushrooms can be produced. Fungi generally survive in soil for years and produce fruiting structures only when conditions are favorable, such as after periods of prolonged wet weather. Because mushrooms are merely the fruiting bodies of fungi, removing them doesn't kill the underground mycelia from which they are growing. Picking mushrooms, puffballs, stinkhorns, or other reproductive structures soon after they appear might prevent their spores from spreading to new sites. However, because most spores are windblown long distances, they can easily come into a lawn from neighboring areas. The primary reasons for removing mushrooms from lawns are to keep them away from children and pets and to improve a lawn's appearance. Fairy Rings Fairy ring fungi can cause circular or semicircular green bands of grass in a lawn. Rings can be 1 to 12 or more feet in diameter, and mushrooms might or might not be present. Fairy rings get their name from the ancient belief that mushrooms grew in circles where fairies danced. All grasses are susceptible to fairy rings, and several species of mushroom-producing fungi can be involved. Some common species that grow in fairy rings include Marasmius oreades, Chlorophyllum molybdites, and Agaricus campestris, among others. Sometimes the only effect of the fungus is to stimulate grass growth in arcs or circles; this growth is caused by the release of plant nutrients as the fungal hyphae decompose organic matter in the soil. In other cases the soil just inside the ring can become so permeated by the fungal growth that water penetration is hindered and the grass in that area grows poorly or dies. Wherever there is bare soil, weeds and undesirable grasses can become established. Fairy rings often continue to enlarge for many years, and as the ring expands, the older portions of the fungus in the center die. When the only effect of a fairy ring fungus is a ring of tall green grass, increasing fertilizer and irrigation in the surrounding lawn will usually mask these symptoms. If fairy ring has caused significant dying or dead areas of grass, lawn renovation might be required. If the grass isn't dead, it can reestablish itself if water penetration is improved by breaking up the dense fungal mat of mycelia. To improve penetration, remove cores of soil that are at least 1/4 to 1 inch in diameter and slightly deeper than the fungal mat. Determine the depth of the fungal mat by probing the lawn area with a trowel, shovel, or long screwdriver. If the mat is fewer than 3 inches thick, using a lawn aerator a few times a year might be sufficient to improve water penetration. Begin 2 feet outside the margin of the ring and work inward. Sweep or rake up the cores and remove them from the turfgrass. If the fungal mat is more than 3 inches thick, a lawn aerator might not be able to effectively remove infested soil cores of sufficient length. Also, lawn aerators might not be powerful enough to penetrate some soils. In these cases, a soil probe, small auger, or shovel might be needed to penetrate through and break up the fungal mat. Remove as much of the infested soil as possible and refill large holes with fresh soil that is relatively free of organic matter. After treatment, water until the soil is thoroughly wet. Be sure to wash the coring implement before using it in healthy lawn areas. Dead areas in tall fescue or other bunch-type lawns might need to be reseeded. Creeping grasses such as bermudagrass will eventually fill in. In general it is faster and more effective to manage fairy rings in the home lawn with the cultural practices mentioned above than with a fungicide. Fungicides containing azoxystrobin or flutolanil aren't readily available to the home gardener and require multiple applications and proper timing over a long period of time. Where complete eradication is desired, remove the soil and sod to at least a depth of 1 foot and 18 inches beyond the outside edge of the ring. Refill the trench with fresh soil and reseed the area. Be careful not to spill any infested soil on adjacent healthy areas. Other Mushrooms Mushrooms found in lawns often develop from buried scraps of construction lumber, dead tree roots, or other organic matter. The fungi that produce these mushrooms are beneficial, because they decompose organic matter in the soil, making nutrients available to other plants. These mushrooms are usually harmless to grasses, but some people consider them unsightly or want to get rid of them because young children play in the area. Remove mushrooms growing from buried wood or roots by picking the mushrooms as they appear or by digging out the wood. Sometimes you can eliminate mushrooms growing from organic matter or hasten decomposition of organic matter by applying nitrogen fertilizer at a rate of 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn. The nitrogen should be readily available and not a slow-release or water-insoluble formulation. Examples include 5 pounds of ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) or special lawn fertilizers such as 6 pounds of 16-6-8 or 4 pounds of 27-3-4 per 1,000 square feet of lawn. Fertilization hastens decomposition of organic matter. Mushrooms in lawns are also commonly associated with overirrigation or poor drainage. Removing excess thatch and aerating the soil to improve water penetration in the lawn can help in some cases. Inky caps Inky caps, Coprinus species, are a common yet distinctive group of lawn mushrooms. They are so named because the cap of the mushroom decomposes into dark liquid resembling ink shortly after its appearance in the lawn. Mycorrhizae Some beneficial fungi, known as mycorrhizal fungi, connect themselves to tree, shrub, and herbaceous plant roots. These fungi help plants absorb nutrients and water from the soil. The type of mycorrhizal fungi that grow in association with turf produce microscopic spores, while many mycorrhizal fungi of trees and some shrubs produce spore-bearing mushrooms. Hence, mushrooms produced by these fungi can sometimes appear in lawns if their host is nearby. Many landscape treesparticularly oaks, pines, and other coniferscan't grow or might grow poorly without the help of these fungal partners. Armillaria mellea This fungus often fruits from the base of a tree, from a tree stump, or in a lawn where a tree has been removed. It often produces clusters of honey-colored mushrooms in fall. Several hundred different trees and shrubs are attacked and killed by it. The mushrooms usually don't appear until the host tree is dead or in advanced stages of decline. For more information, see the Pest Notes: Armillaria Root Rot. Mushrooms in newly laid sod Mushrooms often appear in a new sod lawn during sod establishment. Common species of mushroom include Panaeolus foenisecii, which are small with slender stems, brown gills and spores, and cone heads, and Conocybe, which are small and light-colored with slender stems and smooth cone-shaped caps. Clitocybe species may also occur in new lawns. New sod lawns usually require frequent irrigations to become established, creating an ideal environment for the growth of mushrooms. The mushrooms don't harm the lawn and will disappear when irrigation is reduced. Other Fungal Reproductive Structures in the Lawn The following fungi don't cause real damage to a lawn but can be unsightly, foul-smelling, a concern for children and pets, or merely a curiosity. They aren't infectious or parasitic on lawns but live on decaying plant material. CAUTION: SOME MUSHROOMS ARE POISONOUS! Do not eat wild mushrooms or other fungal fruiting bodies unless you are well acquainted with the different species. Many species are poisonous, and ONLY an expert can distinguish between edible and poisonous species. There are no simple tests that can be used to identify poisonous mushrooms. Small children tend to put anything, including mushrooms, in their mouths, so remove all obvious fungal reproductive structures from the yard before allowing a child to play there. Pets also can be harmed by ingesting poisonous mushrooms. For more information on poisonous mushrooms in California, see the Bay Area Mycological Society Web site. Stinkhorns Stinkhorn fungi produce a fruiting body that sticks up through the lawn; when mature, they resemble a giant finger or phallus. The tip of the stalk is covered by spores in a gooey slime that stinks. The terrible odor attracts flies and other insects, which pick up and spread the spores. Dig out or handpick the stinkhorns. Puffballs The fruiting body of puffball fungi is an enclosed ball that opens, or ruptures, to release thousands of spores when mature . In lawns, puffballs usually are an inch or less in size but can be larger. Most puffballs are creamy white on the inside and outside when young. At maturity the inside of the puffball is filled with dark-colored spores. This fungus doesn't require any management but may be removed to prevent children or pets from ingesting it. Bird's nests Bird's nest fungi produce fruiting bodies that resemble tiny nests with eggs. Though not eggs, these small spheres contain spores. Bird's nest fungi usually occur in groups that can be a few inches in diameter. This fungus doesn't typically require any management, as the fruiting bodies are small and don't normally attract pets or children. In any case, none is known to be toxic. Slime molds Slime molds aren't true fungi but primitive organisms that grow in similar environments. Although they sometimes occur in lawns, they are more common on mulch in landscaped areas. They form a gooey mass (plasmodium) that can look like vomit on the lawn surface. This substance can be various colors, but the common species, Fuligo septica, produces a yellow plasmodium that slowly moves across the lawn, especially at night. The mold eventually dries on the lawn surface and produces dusty masses of spores. Undisturbed slime molds usually disappear in a week or so, but damage to the lawn underneath might result from shading and suffocation. Remove slime molds by raking, mowing, or spraying with a stream of water from a hose. Clusters of Armillaria mushrooms.

       "      'body': {'description': 'Whiteflies are tiny, sap-sucking insects that may become abundant in vegetable and ornamental plantings, especially during warm weather. They excrete sticky honeydew and cause yellowing or death of leaves. Outbreaks often occur when the natural biological control is disrupted. Management is difficult once populations are high.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Despite their name, whiteflies are not true flies (in the insect order Diptera) but are in the order Hemiptera, related to aphids, scales and mealybugs. They derive their name from the mealy white wax covering the adults wings and body. Adults are tiny insects with yellowish bodies and four whitish wings. Although adults of some species have distinctive wing markings, many species are most readily distinguished in the last nymphal (immature) stage, which is wingless and lacks visible legs. Depending on species, whitefly nymphs vary in color from almost transparent yellow or whitish to black with a white fringe (Table 1). Whiteflies develop rapidly in warm weather, and populations can build up quickly in situations where natural enemies are ineffective and when weather and host plants favor outbreaks. Large colonies often develop on the undersides of leaves. The most common pest speciessuch as greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and sweetpotato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci)have a wide host range that includes many weeds and crops. These species breed all year round in warmer parts of California, moving from one host to another as plants are harvested or dry up. Another species of whitefly with a broad host range is the giant whitefly, Aleurodicus dugesii, which invaded Southern California in the early 1990s. It is now found in coastal areas and interior valleys in much of the state on a number of tropical and semi-tropical ornamental species. For more information on this species, see Pest Notes: Giant Whitefly. Other species of whiteflies, especially those on woody species, often have a more limited host range. Table 1 lists common whiteflies in California gardens and landscapes. Whiteflies normally lay their tiny oblong eggs on the undersides of leaves. The eggs hatch, and the young whiteflies gradually increase in size through four nymphal stages called instars. The first nymphal stage (crawler) is barely visible even with a hand lens. The crawlers move around for several hours before settling to begin feeding. Later nymphal stages are immobile, oval, and flattened, with greatly reduced legs and antennae, like small scale insects. The winged adult emerges from the last nymphal stage (sometimes called a pupa, although whiteflies dont have a true complete metamorphosis). All stages feed by sucking plant juices from leaves and excreting excess liquid as drops of honeydew as they feed.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Whiteflies use their piercing, needlelike mouthparts to suck sap from phloem, the food-conducting tissues in plant stems and leaves. Large populations can cause leaves to turn yellow, appear dry, or fall off plants. Like aphids, whiteflies excrete a sugary liquid called honeydew, so leaves may be sticky or covered with black sooty mold that grows on honeydew (See Pest Notes: Sooty Mold). The honeydew attracts ants, which interfere with the activities of natural enemies that may control whiteflies and other pests. Feeding by the immature sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, can cause plant distortion, discoloration, or silvering of leaves, and may cause serious losses in some vegetable crops. Some whiteflies transmit viruses to certain vegetable crops. Whiteflies are not normally a problem in fruit trees although their populations can build up in citrus, pomegranate and avocado. Several whitefly species occur on ornamental trees and shrubs (see Table 1), but most are uncommon because of natural controls such as parasites and predators. Most whiteflies on trees have limited host ranges. Low levels of whiteflies are not usually damaging. Adults by themselves will not cause significant damage unless they are transmitting a plant pathogen. Generally, plant losses do not occur unless there is a significant population of whitefly nymphs.',\n",
       "       'management': 'Management of heavy whitefly infestations is difficult. The best strategy is to prevent problems from developing in your garden or landscape. In many situations, natural enemies will provide adequate control of whiteflies; outbreaks often occur when natural enemies are disrupted by insecticide applications, dusty conditions, or interference by ants. Avoid or remove plants that repeatedly host high populations of whiteflies. In gardens, whitefly populations in the early stages of population development can be held down by a vigilant program of removing infested leaves or hosing down with water sprays. Reflective mulches can repel whiteflies from vegetable gardens, and yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor or, at high levels, reduce whitefly numbers. If you choose to use insecticides, insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem oil may reduce but not eliminate populations. Systemic insecticides may be more effective but can have negative impacts on beneficial insects and pollinators. Table 1. Major Economic Hosts of Some Common Whiteflies. Ash whitefly (Siphoninus phillyreae) Host plants: many broadleaved trees and shrubs including ash, citrus, Bradford pear and other flowering fruit trees, pomegranate, redbud, toyon. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have a very thick band of wax down the back and a fringe of tiny tubes, each with a liquid droplet at the end. Adults are white. Ash whitefly is now under good biological control in CA, so it is rarely seen in high numbers. Greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) Host plants: very broad including most vegetables and herbaceous ornamentals. Also may occur on avocado, fuchsia, gardenia, lantana and redbud. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have very long waxy filaments and a marginal fringe. Adults have white wings and a yellow surface or substrate. Bandedwinged whitefly (Trialeurodes abutilonea) Host plants: very broad including cotton, cucurbits, other vegetables. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have short, waxy filaments around their edges. Adults have brownish bands across the wings, and their body is gray. Iris whitefly (Aleyrodes spiraeoides) Host plants: iris, gladiolus, many vegetables, cotton and other herbaceous plants. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no fringe or waxy filaments but are located near distinctive circles of wax where egg laying took place. Adults have a dot on each wing and are quite waxy. Citrus whitefly (Dialeurodes citri) Host plants: citrus, gardenia, ash, ficus, pomegranate. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no fringe around their edges but have a distinctive Y-shape on their backs. Adults are white. Mulberry whitefly (Tetraleurodes mori) Host plants: avocado, citrus, mulberry, other trees. Characteristics: Nymphs have blackish, oval bodies with white, waxy fringe. Adults have reddish to gray wing markings. Crown whitefly (Aleuroplatus coronata) Host plants: oak, chestnut. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs are black with large amounts of white wax arranged in a crownlike pattern. Adults are white. Sweetpotato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) Host plants: very broad including many herbaceous and some woody plants including cole crops, cotton, cucurbits, tomatoes, peppers, crape myrtle, lantana, roses, and hibiscus. Characteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no waxy filaments or marginal fringe. Adults have white wings and yellow body; they hold their wings slightly tilted to surface or substrate. Giant whitefly (Aleurodicus dugesii) Host plants: avocado, begonia, hibiscus, giant bird of paradise, orchid tree, banana, mulberry, vegetables, and many ornamentals. Characteristics: Adults are up to 0.19 inch long. They leave spirals of wax on leaves. Nymphs have long filaments of wax that can be up to 2 inches long and give leaves a bearded appearance. For more information, see Pest Notes : Giant Whitefly. Woolly whitefly (Aleurothrixus floccosus) Host plants: citrus, eugenia. Characteristics: Nymphs are covered with fluffy, waxy filaments. Adults are white. Biological Control Whiteflies have many natural enemies, and outbreaks frequently occur when these natural enemies have been disturbed or destroyed by pesticides, dust buildup, or other factors. General predators include lacewings, bigeyed bugs, and minute pirate bugs . Several small lady beetles including Clitostethus arcuatus (on ash whitefly) and scale predators, such as Scymnus or Chilocorus species, and the Asian multicolored lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, feed on whiteflies. Whiteflies have a number of naturally occurring parasites that can be very important in controlling some species. Encarsia spp. parasites are commercially available for release in greenhouse situations; however, they are not generally recommended for outdoor use because they are not well adapted for survival in temperate zones. You can evaluate the degree of natural parasitization in your plants by checking empty whitefly pupal cases. Those that were parasitized will have round or oval exit holes and those from which a healthy adult whitefly emerged will have a T-shaped exit hole. Whitefly nymphs can sometimes be checked for parasitization before emergence by noting a darkening in their color. However, some whitefly parasites do not turn hosts black; and some species of whitefly nymphs that occur on ornamentals are black in their healthy, unparasitized state. Avoiding the use of insecticides that kill natural enemies is a very important aspect of whitefly management. Products containing carbaryl, pyrethroids, or imidacloprid (especially as a foliar application) can be particularly disruptive. Control of dust and ants, which protect whiteflies from their natural enemies, can also be important, especially in citrus or other trees. Removal Hand removal of leaves or plants heavily infested with the nonmobile nymphal and pupal stages may reduce populations to levels that natural enemies can contain. Remove and destroy whitefly-infested vegetable plants after harvest. Always inspect new plants for whiteflies and nymphs before introducing them in the greenhouse or garden. If you have evergreen perennial plants that consistently host high populations of whiteflies in the winter season, then you may wish to remove these plants to lower overwintering populations. If you have high populations of whiteflies in a greenhouse, removing all host plants from the greenhouse for at least 2 weeks (and assuring that no whiteflies can enter from outside) may eliminate problems. Water sprays (syringing) may also be useful in dislodging adults. Watering can also reduce the hot, dry dusty conditions that favor whiteflies and inhibit their natural enemies. Reflective Mulches Shiny metallic-coated construction paper or reflective plastic mulches can repel whiteflies, especially away from small plants. Alternatively, you can spray clear plastic mulch with silver paint. Reflective plastic mulches are available online and in some garden stores. When putting a reflective mulch in your garden, first remove all weeds. Place the mulch on the plant beds and bury the edges with soil to hold them down. After the mulch is in place, cut 3- to 4-inch diameter holes and plant several seeds or single transplants in each one. You may be able to furrow irrigate or sprinkle your beds if you use coated construction paper or other porous mulch if it is sturdy enough to tolerate sprinkling. Plastic mulches will require drip irrigation. In addition to repelling whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers, the mulch will enhance crop growth and control weeds. Reflective mulches have been shown to deter pests that transmit viruses in commercial vegetable crops, perhaps helping to reduce disease incidence and crop loss. When summertime temperatures get high, remove mulches to prevent overheating plants. Traps In vegetable gardens, yellow sticky traps can be posted around the garden to trap adults. Such traps wont eliminate damaging populations but may reduce them somewhat as a component of an integrated management program relying on multiple tactics. Whiteflies do not fly very far, so many traps may be needed. You may need as many as one trap for every two large plants, with the sticky yellow part of the trap level with the whitefly infestation. Place traps with the sticky side facing plants but out of direct sunlight. Traps are most useful for monitoring and detecting whiteflies rather than controlling them. Commercial traps or sticky cards are available in stores and online. Additionally, you can make traps out of 1/4-inch plywood or masonite board, painted bright yellow, and mounted on pointed wooden stakes. Drive stakes into the soil close to the plants that are to be protected. Although commercially available sticky materials such as Tanglefoot are commonly used as coatings for the traps, you might want to try to make your own adhesive from one-part petroleum jelly or mineral oil and one-part household detergent. This material can be easily cleaned off boards with soap and water, whereas a commercial solvent must be used to remove the other adhesives. Periodic cleaning is essential to remove insects and debris from the boards and maintain the sticky surface. Insecticide Sprays Whiteflies can be difficult to control with insecticides. Most less-toxic products such as insecticidal soaps, neem oil, or petroleum-based oils control only those whiteflies that are directly sprayed. Therefore, plants must be thoroughly covered with the spray solution, and repeat applications may be necessary. Be sure to cover undersides of all infested leaves; usually these are the lowest leaves and the most difficult to reach. Use soaps or oils when plants are not drought-stressed and when temperatures are under 90F to prevent possible burn damage to plants. Early evening, when there is enough light to safely apply products but when the sun is not shining directly on plants, may be a good time to spray. The soil-applied systemic insecticide imidacloprid can control whitefly nymphs. Imidacloprid can have negative impacts on natural enemies, honey bees and other pollinators in the garden, especially when applied as a foliar spray or as a soil application to plants that are flowering or soon to be flowering. It can also cause outbreaks of spider mites. Reserve its use for special situations where these problems can be avoided. Avoid using other pesticides (other than soaps and oils) to control whiteflies; not only do most of them kill natural enemies, whiteflies quickly build up resistance to them, and most are not very effective in garden situations.'},\n",

Spiders that might injure peoplefor example, black widowsgenerally spend most of their time hidden under furniture or boxes, or in woodpiles, corners, or crevices. The spiders commonly seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people.',\n",

       "       'development': 'Spiders resemble insects and sometimes are confused with them, but they are arachnids, not insects. Spiders have eight legs and two body partsa head region (cephalothorax) and an abdomen. They lack wings and antennae. Although spiders often are found on plants, they eat mainly insects, other spiders, and related arthropods, not plants. Most spiders have toxic venom, which they use to kill their prey. However, only those spiders whose venom typically causes a serious reaction in humans are called poisonous spiders. See the sidebar: Spider Bites. Table 1. Common Spider Families in North America. Agelenidae, funnel weavers or grass spiders Sit-and-wait predators feed during the day and night on the ground in most types of vegetation, including low-growing plants and trees. Spin funnel-shaped webs, often with several-inch-wide, flat extension covering plants or soil. The spider waits in the hole of its web. When it detects vibrations from an insect that flew or walked into the web, the spider runs out, captures and bites the prey, then carries it back into the funnel to be eaten. Webs on low vegetation become conspicuous in morning light after collecting dew. Funnel weavers have six or eight eyes, all about the same size, arranged in two rows. About 300 species in North America. Araneidae, orb weavers or garden spiders Feed on insects that fly, fall, or are blown into web. Elaborate silken webs are spun in concentric circles. Spiderlings often make symmetrical webs; mature spiders may spin a more specialized design that is helpful in identifying certain species. The spider rests at the center of its web or hides in a shelter near the edge, waiting for prey to become entangled. Orb weavers generally have poor vision and rely on web vibrations to locate and identify prey. About 200 species in North America. Clubionidae (including Corinnidae), sac spiders or twoclawed hunting spiders Stalk and capture prey that is walking or resting on surfaces. They spin silken tubes or sacs under bark, among leaves, and in low plants or on the ground, where they hide during the day or retreat after hunting. Commonly are nocturnal, medium-sized, pale spiders with few markings. About 200 species in North America. Linyphiidae (=Microphantidae), dwarf spiders Prey on insects that fall, walk, or land in their web. Diurnal (day active) spiders occurring in the plant canopy and among litter on the ground. They produce sheetlike webs on the surface of plants or soil and are common in some field and vegetable crops. Most are relatively small. Several hundred species in North America. Lycosidae, wolf spiders Prey on insects that are walking or resting on the ground. Actively hunt in the open during the day and night, often observed on the ground in litter and on low vegetation. Can occur in burrows and under debris on soil. Instead of spinning webs to catch prey, make a small, thick web where they rest. Have a distinctive pattern of eyes: four small eyes in front in a straight row, one middle pair of larger eyes, and one rear pair of widely spaced eyes on top of the head. They have long hairy legs. They are usually black and white or strongly contrasting light and dark, which can make them difficult to discern unless they are moving. About 200 species in North America. Oxyopidae, lynx spiders Stalk and capture resting or walking insects. Active hunters with good vision. Most have spiny legs and a brightly colored body that tapers sharply toward the rear. They have four pairs of eyes grouped in a hexagon. About 2 dozen known species in North America. Salticidae, jumping spiders Day-active hunters in plants or on the ground. They make no web; instead they stalk and pounce on prey by jumping distances many times their body length. Jumping spiders have a distinctive pattern of eyes in three rows: the first row of four eyes, with large and distinctive middle eyes; a second row of two very small to minute eyes; and a third row of two medium sized eyes. They usually have an iridescent, metallic-colored abdomen and black carapace. About 300 species in North America. Theridiidae, cobweb, cobweb weaver, or combfooted spiders Feed on insects that walk or fly into their webs. Almost always found hanging upside down by their claws in irregularly spun, sticky webs, waiting for prey. The spider is usually concealed in a corner of the web, in a silken tent, or behind debris. This group includes the black widow spider, which produces relatively thick silk that feels rough and sticky. They generally have a soft, round, bulbous abdomen and slender legs without spines. Over 200 species in North America. Thomisidae, crab spiders or flower spiders Stalk and capture insects walking or resting on surfaces. Diurnal hunters that do not spin webs. Front two pairs of legs are enlarged and extend beyond the side of their flattened body, making them look like tiny crabs. Their small eyes occur in two slightly curved rows, with the top row often much wider than the lower row. Over 200 species in North America. Black Widow Spider The black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most common harmful spider in California. Venom from its bite can cause reactions ranging from mild to painful and serious, but death is very unlikely and many symptoms can be alleviated if medical treatment is obtained. Anyone bitten by this spider should remain calm and promptly seek medical advice; it is helpful if the offending spider can be caught and saved for identification. The typical adult female black widow has a shiny black body, slender black legs, and a red or orange mark in the shape of an hourglass on the underside of the large, round abdomen. The body, excluding legs, is 5/16 to 5/8 inch long. Only the larger immature female and adult female spiders are able to bite through a persons skin and inject enough venom to cause a painful reaction. The adult male black widow is one-half to two-thirds the length of the female, has a small abdomen, and is seldom noticed. The male black widow does possess venom, but its fangs are too small to break human skin. The top side of its abdomen is olive-greenish gray with a pattern of cream-colored areas and one light-colored band going lengthwise down the middle. The hourglass mark on the underside of the abdomen typically is yellow or yellow-orange and broad waisted. The legs are banded with alternating light and dark areas. Contrary to popular belief, the female black widow rarely eats the male after mating but may do so if hungry. Like males, young female black widow spiders are patterned on the top side. In the early stages they greatly resemble males but gradually acquire the typical female coloration with each shedding of the skin. In intermediate stages they have tan or cream-colored, olive-gray, and orange markings on the top side of the abdomen, a yellowish orange hourglass mark on the underside, and banded legs. Webs and Egg Sacs The web of the black widow is an irregular, tough-stranded, sticky cobweb mesh in which the spider hangs with its underside up. During the day it often hides under an object at the edge of the web or stays in a silken retreat in the center. The black widow may rush out of its hiding place when the web is disturbed, especially if egg sacs are present. The egg sacs are mostly spherical, about 1/2 inch long and 5/8 inch in diameter, creamy yellow to light tan in color, opaque, and tough and paperlike on the surface. A female may produce several egg sacs. Tiny, young black widows, which are nearly white in color, disperse to new locations by ballooning and infest new areas. Spider Bites Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-222-1222). Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, apply an antiseptic to prevent infection, and use ice or ice water to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary, try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist. Where the Spiders Live. Black widow spiders occur in most parts of California. They and their associated webs usually are found in dark, dry, sheltered, relatively undisturbed places such as among piles of wood, rubbish, or stones; in culverts, hollow stumps, and old animal burrows; in garages, sheds, barns, crawl spaces, utility meter boxes, and outhouses; and sometimes among plants. People are most likely to be bitten when they disturb the spider while they are cleaning out or picking up items in such places. A sensible precaution is to always wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt when working in areas that have been undisturbed for a time and where there are good hiding places for spiders. Effects of the Bite. The symptoms of a black widow bite are largely internal; little more than local redness and swelling may develop at the bite site. The internal effects may range from mild to severe. Pain tends to spread from the bite to other parts of the body and muscular spasms may develop. In severe cases the abdominal muscles may become quite rigid. Other effects can include profuse sweating, fever, increased blood pressure, difficulty breathing and speaking, restlessness, and nausea. Typically, the pain and other symptoms reach a maximum within a day of the bite, then gradually subside over the next 2 to 3 days. Most people who are bitten spend a few hours under observation by a physician but do not develop symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Small children, the elderly, and persons with health problems are likely to suffer some of the more severe consequences of the bite. Black widow bites are fairly common in California. Yellow Sac Spider The common, house-dwelling agrarian sac or yellow sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum, is a small spider that spins a silken sac web in the corners of ceilings and walls, and behind shelves and pictures; it is also commonly found outdoors in shrubbery. This spider is light yellow and has a slightly darker stripe on the upper middle of the abdomen. The eight eyes of this spider are all about equal in size and arranged in two horizontal rows. Yellow sac spiders can be seen running on walls and ceilings at night and quickly drop to the floor to escape if they are disturbed. Bites usually occur when the spider becomes trapped against a persons skin in clothing or bedding. It is estimated that sac spiders are responsible for more bites on people than any other spider. Typical symptoms of a bite include initial pain, redness, and sometimes swelling. Recluse Spiders Recluse spiders of the genus Loxosceles include the well-known brown recluse spider, L. reclusa, which does not occur in California. While the brown recluse has occasionally been brought into California in household furnishings, firewood, and motor vehicles, it does not reside in the state. However, populations of another recluse spider, the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta), were found in Los Angeles County in the late 1960s. In its native Chile it is known to have a bite that is toxic to humans. The native recluse spider of California (L. deserta) is found in the desert regions of southern California and neighboring states. Its bite can cause problems, but it is not as toxic as that of the Chilean recluse. In any case, bites from the desert recluse are rare and no bites from the Chilean recluse have ever been recorded in California despite its presence in heavily populated urban areas. Both the native desert recluse spider and the Chilean recluse spider occur principally in the drier areas of southern California. Recluse spiders can have a violin-shaped mark (with the neck of the violin pointing backward) on the top side of the head region (cephalothorax). However, the mark is not always distinct, so it should not be used as an identifying character. A unique feature of recluse spiders is their six eyes, arranged in pairs in a semicircle, which can be seen with the use of a good hand lens. Most other spiders have eight eyes. All recluse spiders make large, irregular, flattened, cobweb-type webs with thick strands extending in all directions. These spiders avoid light, are active at night, and tend to build their webs in out-of-the-way places. Chilean recluse spiders may be found indoors in boxes, in corners, behind pictures, in old clothing hanging undisturbed, and in other similar places. Desert recluse spiders appear outdoors where they may be found under rocks or wood. More detailed information on these spiders is available in Pest Notes: Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders . Other Spiders In addition to the species mentioned above, there are only a few other species of spiders in California that may on occasion bite humans. (Remember, if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician). One kind of red and black jumping spider, Phidippus johnsoni, may bite if it is disturbed, but the bites are usually not serious. The female spiders are black with red on the top side of the abdomen whereas the males are all red. These spiders range in size from 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Tarantulas are long-lived spiders that occupy burrows in the ground during the day but often come out at night to hunt insects near the burrow. They commonly are feared because of their large size and hairy appearance. Some poisonous tarantulas occur in tropical parts of the world, but the bites of California tarantulas are not likely to be seriousat worst, they are similar to a bee sting. However, because of the variety of tarantulas sold in the pet trade industry, there is a spectrum of venom potencies among these creatures. These spiders ranges from 1 to 2 inches in body size. The hobo spider, Tegenaria agrestis, also called the aggressive house spider, is a common spider in the Pacific Northwest. It builds funnel-shaped webs in dark, moist areas such as basements, window wells, wood piles, and around the perimeter of homes. It is a large (1 to 13/4 inch, including legs), fast-running brown spider with a herringbone or multiple chevron pattern on the top of the abdomen. The hobo spider has not been documented in California, but it has expanded its range from the Pacific Northwest to northern Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Although it has been stated as being a poisonous spider, recent research is challenging the original data that elevated this spider to medical importance. See Pest Notes: Hobo Spiders . One spider frequently found indoors is the common house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, which makes a cobweb in corners of rooms, in windows, and in similar places. Another is the marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, which was introduced into the state in the 1970s and has since displaced the once common longbodied cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides, a long-legged spider that resembles a daddy-longlegs. These spiders are only marginally capable of biting humans because their fangs are too short to pierce peoples skin; they primarily cause problems by producing messy cobwebs. Various kinds of small hunting spiders may wander indoors and occasionally, rather large, hunting-type spiders are discovered in homes or garages. Often these are fully grown wolf spider or tarantula males that have reached maturity and are searching for females. When these spiders are wandering, one or more may accidentally get indoors. New houses and other structures in developments may be invaded by wolf spiders that have lost their usual outdoor living places. The more insects that exist inside a building, the more likely it is to have spiders living there. Usually spiders are most abundant in fall following the first few rains of the season. Immature and adult female burrow-living spiders sometimes wander for a time during the rainy season if they have had to abandon wet burrows.',\n",

       "       'management': 'Spiders may enter houses and other structures through cracks and other openings. They also may be carried in on items like plants, firewood, and boxes. To prevent spiders from coming indoors, seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors. Good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they prey upon. Regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, basements, and other seldom used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive the tumbling process through the hose. Indoors, a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider because occupied spider webs are maintained for cleanliness to enhance prey capture. Individual spiders can also be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. They can then be released outdoors. Watch this video to learn more: How to catch a spider. In indoor storage areas, place boxes off the floor and away from walls, whenever possible, to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders. Sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within. Clean up clutter in garages, sheds, basements, and other storage areas. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Outdoors, eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash, leaf litter, heavy vegetation, and other accumulations of materials. Trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attracts spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Chemical Control: Insecticides will not provide long-term control and should not generally be used against spiders outdoors. Typically, controlling spiders with pesticides is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control, including pyrethrins and pyrethroids (synthetic versions of pyrethrins) such as resmethrin, allethrin, or combinations of these products. Control by spraying is only temporary unless accompanied by housekeeping. It is just as easy and much less toxic to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe or to vacuum it up. Sticky traps offer a noninsecticidal way to remove spiders from your home as long as you can place the traps where pets and children cant tamper with them. Sorptive dusts containing amorphous silica gel (silica aerogel) and pyrethrins, which can be applied by professional pest control applicators only, may be useful in certain indoor situations. Sorptive dust particles affect the outer covering of spiders (and also insects) that have crawled over a treated surface, causing them to dry out and die. When applied as a dustlike film and left in place, a sorptive dust provides permanent protection against spiders. The dust is most safely and effectively used in cracks and crevices and in attics, wall voids, and other enclosed or unused places. SPIDER BITES: Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically, the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-876-4766 or 1-800-8-POISON). One must also keep in mind that although it is impossible to be certain, people and their physicians often blame spiders as the cause of skin lesions with no proof of spider involvement when there are many similar-appearing, non-spider maladies; therefore, care must be exerted in the diagnostic process. Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, and use ice, ice water or cold compresses to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite.

       "      'body': {'description': 'Contrary to popular belief, there are no populations of the brown recluse, Loxosceles reclusa, in California. In fact, fewer than 20 verified specimens have been collected in the state over several decades by spider experts. Yet people in California frequently relate stories in which they or someone they know was supposedly bitten or they have had a physician diagnose them with a brown recluse spider bite. Black widows on the other hand, are very common throughout the state, causing potentially serious injury with their bite. The adult females are easily identifiable by their shiny black body color and red hourglass on the belly. For information on black widows, see the Pest Notes: Widow Spiders and Their Relatives. Although the brown recluse does not live in California, four species of native recluse spiders occur in southern areas of the state and can cause similar medical concerns. The most common Californian recluse spider is the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta . It is found mostly in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, in the foothills of the lower San Joaquin Valley, and in adjacent areas of Mexico; most of these areas are sparsely populated by humans. This publication was written to provide science-based information about the status of the brown recluse and other related spiders in California. COMMON AND SCIENTIFIC NAMES Over the years, the group of spiders to which the brown recluse belongs has been known by various colloquial names: \"violin\" spiders, \"fiddleback\" spiders, \"recluse\" spiders, and \"brown\" spiders. The recluse spiders are in the family Sicariidae (formerly Loxoscelidae). The scientific name for the recluse spider genus is Loxosceles (lox-SOS-a-leez) and rhymes somewhat with \"isosceles\" as in the triangle. Whereas \"isosceles\" means equal legs, \"loxosceles\" means slanted legs, referring to the way the recluse spiders hold their legs at rest. All known members of the group have scientific names, and the more familiar members of this group also have common names (e.g., brown recluse, desert recluse, Arizona recluse).',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'The most definitive physical feature of recluse spiders is their eyes : most spiders have 8 eyes that typically are arranged in 2 rows of 4, but recluse spiders have 6 equal-sized eyes arranged in 3 pairs, each pair called dyads. There is a dyad at the front of the cephalothorax (the first main body part to which the legs attach) and another dyad on each side further back with a space separating the dyads from one another. Many publications refer to the \"violin\" marking on the dorsal (top) surface of the cephalothorax (head region) as the most important diagnostic feature. Although this marking is fairly consistent in mature brown recluses and Texan recluses (Loxosceles devia), it can vary in intensity, sometimes fading on preserved specimens, and it is very faint to nonexistent in several recluse species found in the southwestern United States (e.g., the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta). Therefore, checking the eye pattern is the best way to eliminate almost all suspect non-recluse spiders from consideration, whereas the presence or absence of the violin marking may lead to misidentifications. Non-arachnologists (including physicians, pest control operators, and even some entomologists) have envisioned \"violins\" on various body surfaces of harmless spiders and incorrectly assume that they have properly identified a brown recluse spider. In addition, the abdomens of all North American recluses are covered with fine hairs and are uniformly colored (not patterned), although the coloration can vary from light beige to dark brown, depending in part on what they have eaten recently. There is never a color pattern on the abdomen of North American specimens. Finally, the uniformly colored legs are similarly covered with fine hairs whereas many non-recluse spiders have stout spines and a pattern of stripes, rings, or spots on their legs. Some other spiders share one or more of these physical characteristics. However, to be identified as a recluse spider, it must have all 5 of these characteristics. six eyes in dyads (pairs) uniformly colored abdomen with fine hairs no spines on the legs uniformly colored legs body not more than 3/8\" in length On this basis, more than 99% of the spiders found by Californians can be identified as something other than a recluse spider. In the unlikely event that one does find a recluse spider in California, it will most likely be the native desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta. To identify Loxosceles spiders to species level requires a high-magnification microscope and the skills of a spider expert (arachnologist). SPIDERS COMMONLY CONFUSED WITH RECLUSES Because of the misinformation surrounding the brown recluse\\'s presence in California, many spiders that are virtually harmless are submitted by the public to arachnologists for identification. Most of them are not from the recluse family and some are not even spiders. A nationwide study was undertaken from 2000 to 2005, offering to identify any spider that was considered to be a brown recluse spider. Nearly 600 specimens were submitted from California, many from people who were adamant that they had a brown recluse. Only one of these specimens was a brown recluse, from a house where the family had moved from Missouri, a state that is well-known to have abundant brown recluse populations. No additional recluses were found in the house. The occasional finding of a translocated brown recluse spider is not surprising; however, it still is extremely rare. There were 17 desert recluse spiders submitted in this study, all from the desert regions of southeastern California where the spiders are known to occur. Non-recluse spiders were submitted in great numbers including many false black widows, woodlouse, and yellow sac spiders. Presented below are descriptions of spiders that share some of the same physical features as the brown recluse and have been misidentified as recluse spiders. For additional information on these spiders, consult a spider identification book such as Common Spiders of North America by Richard Bradley, listed in the References section or the table of common spider families found in California, located in the Pest Notes: Spiders . Six-Eyed Spiders Spitting spiders (Scytodes spp.) are closely related to recluse spiders and have 6 eyes arranged in a similar pattern. However, unlike recluse spiders, they also have many black spots or lines on their bodies and a strongly domed cephalothorax. The woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata, has 6 eyes arranged in 2 groups of 3 (triads) and no bodily markings. Spiders with Violin-Shaped or Other Dark Markings Many common tan or gray spiders have dark markings on the head region, which convinces people that they have caught a true recluse spider. These spiders include cellar spiders (Pholcus phalangioides, Psilochorus spp., Physocyclus spp.), pirate spiders (Mimetus spp.), and sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae family). The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, also confuses people even though the dark marks are on the ventral (underside) not the dorsal (top) surface of the body. The most common submissions as brown recluses are spiders in the genus Titiotus . These spiders are found just north of Los Angeles, through central California to Redding and are common in forests. Titiotus spiders have a hair pattern that gives the impression of a violin and its coloration is similar to that of a brown recluse. Another frequent submission is Zoropsis spinimana, which is found in the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento. It is a harmless Mediterranean immigrant species, first detected in California around 1995. It is large and frequently captured in homes. Residents see the dark marking on the top surface of the abdomen as a violin, but recluses have this type of marking on their cephalothorax. See the Pest Notes: Zoropsis spinimana, A Mediterranean Spider in California for more information. Ubiquitous Brown Spiders Virtually every spider that is tan or brown has been turned in by Californians as a potential brown recluse. There are hundreds of species of these spiders in California. They include ground spiders (Gnaphosidae), sac spiders (Cheiracanthium spp., Trachelas spp.), wolf spiders (Lycosidae), grass spiders (Agelenidae), orb weavers (Araneidae), and male crevice spiders (Filistatidae). Additionally, males of both the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the false black widow, Steatoda grossa, are frequently brought in as suspected recluse spiders. All of these brown spiders have 8 eyes and thus can be quickly eliminated from consideration. AMERICAN RECLUSE SPIDERS Eleven species of recluse spiders are native to the United States and two non-natives have become established in certain highly-limited areas of the country. The brown recluse spider is the proper common name for only one species, Loxosceles reclusa . It is the most widespread of the North American recluse spiders and lives in the south central Midwest from southeastern Nebraska to southwestern Ohio and south through Texas to north Georgia. In addition to these native species, the Chilean recluse spider, Loxosceles laeta (pronounced \"LEE-ta\"), has become established in portions of Los Angeles (Alhambra, Sierra Madre, Monterey Park, and San Gabriel). This spider, however, seems to be confined to a very limited area in Los Angeles County, has been present there for at least 80 years (one specimen was collected from Los Angeles in 1936) and is not spreading. Also, occasional interceptions of the Mediterranean recluse, Loxosceles rufescens are found in commercial goods shipped from out-of-state or from international cargo, but no populations of this spider are currently known in California and finds of them are still incredibly rare. Recluse spiders, as their name implies, are reclusive. They build webs as trigger systems to indicate that potential prey are walking nearby. They also use silk to build retreats in which to hide during the day. These nocturnal spiders emerge from their retreats at night and actively hunt down prey or may wait for prey to land in the small area several inches from their retreat. As dawn approaches, they may seek shelter in dark places such as in clothing or shoes, and mature males roam in search of females. It is these two behaviors that can bring them into contact with people. In nature, recluses are found in cracks and crevices in and under rocks or the loose bark of dead trees. Recluses have very much benefited from human-altered environments, where they are readily found under trash cans, plywood, tarps, rubber tires, and in storage boxes. They are synanthropic (found in association with humans) and therefore are considered \"house\" spiders. In fact in South America, the recluse species have common names that translate as \"the spider behind the picture\" or \"the spider in the corner.\" Recluse spiders are relatively long lived. Among the various species, they mature after about 1 year and average a 2- to 4-year life span with some living more than 7 years under laboratory conditions. They are also well known for surviving long periods (6 to 12 months) without food before perishing. Abundance of Recluses One consistent life history characteristic of recluse spiders is that in the right environment their populations are usually dense. If you find recluses, you do not find one, you find many. The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is a common house spider in the midwestern United States. Examples of the densities that the brown recluse can attain around human habitation include 9 under a piece of plywood in Oklahoma, 52 in an indoor laboratory, 6 under a waterbed frame in Arkansas, 40 collected in a Missouri barn in one hour, and 44 caught in sticky traps in a Tennessee home in one day. Eight Oklahoma 13-year-olds unknowingly hand-collected about 60 amongst bricks in about 7 minutes without getting bitten. In a 6-month study, a family in Kansas collected 2,055 brown recluse spiders in their 19th-century built home. They lived there nearly a decade, continued to find brown recluse spiders regularly, and only once in 10 years had anyone shown evidence of a bite; it was to a finger which turned red for a few days and then healed without incident. In fact, on many evenings, this family collected more brown recluse spiders per hour in their home than the entire California human population has ever been able to find in the state. Similarly, for the desert recluse in California, 12 of these spiders were collected under a doghouse in Yucca Valley and 6 were removed in one night from a small cottage bedroom in a Mojave Desert research facility. Absence of Brown Recluses in California Unlike many other spiders that disperse by either migrating or being carried by air currents when small (\"ballooning\"), recluse spiders usually only expand outside their native range as a result of human intervention. The few brown recluses that have been collected in California typically are found in facilities that receive goods from out of state or are unintentionally transported by people who have moved from the Midwest. In these instances, searching the immediate area yielded no additional brown recluses so they were considered to be individual stowaways. Undoubtedly, more brown recluses have been inadvertently brought into the state via commerce and the relocation of household belongings, especially during the Dust Bowl era, however amazingly few specimens have ever been collected. Translocated recluse spiders have never been able to establish a foothold and start a population in California. Considering that brown recluse spider bites are not common in the south-central Midwest where brown recluses frequently cohabit with people, it is clear that California does not have anywhere near sufficient populations of these spiders to be responsible for the number of bites that are attributed to them. RICE Therapy: The recommended treatment for most brown recluse bites (the ones that do not develop severe symptoms) is simple first aid: RICE therapy. R est I ce C ompression E levation',\n",
       "       'damage': 'All Loxosceles spiders tested so far have the venom component that is capable of causing necrotic skin lesions, so it is best to assume that all recluse spiders may be capable of causing skin damage. In general, the desert recluse spider\\'s venom is similar to that of the brown recluse and should be considered of equal potency. In comparison to the brown recluse spider, the Chilean recluse supposedly has more potent venom and the Mediterranean recluse\\'s venom has been said to be less potent. However, these comparisons are more anecdotal than quantitive assessments. About 10% of brown recluse bites cause moderate or greater tissue damage and scarring, but the vast majority only result in inflammation and heal well without medical intervention. Deaths have been reported in children, however these are extremely rare occurrences and can be prevented if accurately diagnosed and the proper medical treatment applied. Medical Misdiagnoses The problem of misdiagnosis is widespread in North America, including such unlikely places as Alaska and Canada where doctors have attributed skin lesions to recluse bites when no brown recluse spiders have ever been found north of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. One reason for the great awareness of the recluse spiders throughout North America is that necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds are commonly misdiagnosed as \"brown recluse bites.\" Although recluses can cause these types of wounds, the biological data involving the distribution of the spider indicate that most of these diagnoses are incorrect. A world-renowned toxicology physician who worked at University of Southern California Medical Center estimates that most general spider bites in California referred to him were actually the work of other arthropods, and that 60% of \"brown recluse spider bite\" diagnoses came from areas where no Loxosceles spiders were known to exist. This is a serious problem, in that several medical conditions misdiagnosed as recluse bites can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal consequences. Additionally, many people diagnosed as having brown recluse bites in California are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics work against bacteria and have no effect on spider venom. However, regardless of the causative agent, it is wise to seek medical attention if you feel that it is warranted. Because most brown recluse bites involve only inflammation, the recommended treatment is simple first aid: RICE therapy (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) although other medical experts suggest cold instead of ice (to avoid freezing tissue) and a neutral position (lay flat) rather than elevated. Multiple Lesions Spiders typically bite only once as a desperate defensive effort before they are crushed between flesh and some object. Therefore, spider bites are not the causes of skin lesions if 1) there are multiple lesions on one person at the same time, especially if the lesions are on widely separated parts of the body, 2) if there are multiple episodes of lesions on the same person over a period of several weeks or months, or 3) if there are multiple people in the same house or facility showing skin lesions at the same time. Multiple lesions immediately point toward the more likely situation of a contagious bacterial infection like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or possibly an infestation of an arthropod (fleas, mites, kissing bugs, bed bugs, etc.) that seeks out mammals for blood meals. Bacterial Infections Group A Streptococcus infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis, is sometimes misdiagnosed as a brown recluse bite, and has a fatality rate that can vary from 20 to 80% depending on how quickly it is correctly diagnosed. In serious cases, death from Strepococcus A can occur in a few days. Another medical condition that is frequently misdiagnosed as a spider bite or brown recluse bite is MRSA bacterial infection. Infections of this pathogen, which began to emerge in the 1990s, are no worse than other Staph infections. However, because they are not remedied by common antibiotics, the infections continue out of control and can be fatal unless properly medicated. In one national study involving 11 university-based medical facilities, 29% of the patients presenting for \"spider bite\" had MRSA as the cause of their skin and soft tissue injury. MRSA is a contagious infection, frequently found in places where people are housed in close quarters for lengthy periods of time. Such conditions include prisons and other correctional facilities, nursing homes, long-term health care facilities, sports camps, military barracks, and locker rooms and typically involve several people being afflicted simultaneously. Very often \"spider bites\" are the first thing that people blame as the cause of these wounds. However, more careful investigation typically leads to identifying a MRSA bacterial infection as the causal agent.The problem clears up quickly when the bacterial infection is correctly diagnosed and treated. Necrotic Wound Causes If you do get a necrotic wound in California, you and your medical professional should consider many other common causes to be much more probable than a bite from a brown recluse spider. If an arthropod is involved at all, one should first consider all those creatures that seek out mammals for blood meals and may cause necrotic-type wounds. These include mites, fleas, bed bugs, mosquitoes, soft ticks, hard ticks, and blood-sucking conenose bugs (also known as kissing bugs) (see Pest Notes : Fleas, Bed Bugs, Mosquitoes, Conenose Bugs, and Lyme Disease in California listed in SUGGESTED READING). In addition, there is a long list of medical conditions and diseases that exhibit necrotic-type wounds. A few of these are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial infections, lymphomatoid papulosis (a non-Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphoma), diabetic ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, infected herpes simplex, herpes zoster (\"shingles\"), chemical and thermal burns, poison ivy, poison oak, and Lyme disease. Any and all of these situations are more likely than the bite of a brown recluse spider in California.',\n",
       "       'management': 'If you do not live in the shaded areas on the map, you do not need to be concerned with recluse spiders in California. If you do live within the range of these spiders, you still need to verify that you have recluses on your property before attempting control. Not all micro-habitats within the shaded areas will be suitable for recluse survival. For example, even though Loxosceles laeta occurs in densely populated sections of Los Angeles, this species is usually found only in dark commercial and municipal storage basements, not in homes. This leaves the desert recluse as the only California species of concern, and a minor one at that. After verifying that you do have desert recluses in your home, there are steps you can take to reduce encounters with them. These measures are similar for reducing encounters with spiders in general. Nonchemical control The most important precaution is to remove or reduce outdoor trash and rubbish, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cansespecially if they are stored right next to the house. In residences with attached garages, block off house access to spiders by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites in self defense. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any bed skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under the bed. This minimizes the chance that any spider can crawl onto the bed and inflict a bite. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally used (gardening clothes and gloves, boots, baseball mitts, seasonal clothes and gear, etc.) should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags or bins, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Sticky traps placed along floor boards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. See the short UC IPM YouTube video How to Catch a Spider. Chemical control Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy and much less toxic for your living area to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify. Freeze the spider first, soak it in rubbing alcohol for a few days to preserve it, then pour off the alcohol and rinse the spider with water to remove alcohol residue before shipping. When sending the spider in for identification, do not mail it in alcohol as this is a violation of postal regulations.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Spiders are mostly beneficial because they feed on pest insects. However, many people think that all spiders are dangerous and aggressive. In California, the main spider capable of causing serious injury is the black widow, which generally remains outdoors and out of sight. Spiders seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people. Focus pest management efforts on removing webs and hiding places. Pesticides are not generally recommended. What to know about spiders: The jaws of most spiders are too small to bite humans. Adult female black widows are the main spiders capable of seriously injuring people in California. They are shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the underside and are commonly found outdoors, in sheltered, dry, undisturbed areas such as wood piles and garages. Anyone bitten by a black widow spider should remain calm and seek medical advice. The brown recluse spider and the hobo spider do not live in California. Some other spiders bite when trapped in clothing or bedding, but the effect is usually no more severe than itching or the reaction to a bee sting. To prevent spiders from entering your house, take these steps: Seal home foundation cracks and other access holes. Inspect window and door screens for good seals to keep out spiders and the insects they prey on. Keep areas around home foundations free of clutter. Manage spiders using these tips: Indoors, regular housecleaning provides adequate spider control. Vacuum up the spider and its web. Alternatively, squash spiders or capture them in a jar and release them outside. Prevent clutter buildup that can provide spider hiding places both indoors and out. Remove spider webs from the exterior of the house with a broom or high pressure hose. Spiders and biological control: When removing spiders, dont overlook the fact that spiders eat a large number and variety of nuisance and pest insects. Spiders also have natural enemieswasps, other spiders, birds, reptiles, and othersthat sometimes keep them from becoming too numerous.',\n",

They have many common names, including nias de la tierra (children of the earth) and sand crickets. They also are sometimes called potato bugs because they are occasional pests of potatoes, but the name potato bug is confusing because it is applied to several different invertebrates, including Colorado potato beetle, pillbugs, sowbugs, and Jerusalem crickets, none of which are true bugs (Heteroptera). Jerusalem crickets feed and tunnel underground during the day and can occur aboveground mostly at night. They are most often seen when exposed by gardeners turning the soil or above ground after heavy irrigation or rainfall, at night, or at twilight during mild weather. They are easily recognized by their bald, round, humanoid head and fat orangish abdomen with black rings. They have long, brownish antennae and spiny hind legs and lack wings. They grow up to about 2 inches long. Nymphs (immatures) look like small adults. Jerusalem crickets hatch from eggs laid in soil and spend much of their time underground. Nymphs molt up to about 10 times before becoming reproductive adults. Their life span can be up to about 2 years. Jerusalem crickets are harmless to people and woody plants. Their food includes insects, nonwoody roots, and tubers. They only occasionally damage turf and vegetables. Aside from their alarming appearance, they generally are not pests. No control is necessary for Jerusalem crickets. They may be important food for certain vertebrate predators. If found where they are not desired, they can be scooped into a box and thrown away.

       "      'body': {'description': 'Mites are common pests in landscapes and gardens that feed on many fruit trees, vines, berries, vegetables, and ornamental plants. Although related to insects, mites arent insects but members of the arachnid class along with spiders and ticks. Spider mites (Figure 1), also called webspinning mites, are the most common mite pests and among the most ubiquitous of all pests in the garden and on the farm. Webspinning spider mites include the Pacific spider mite, twospotted spider mite, strawberry spider mite, and several other species. Most common ones are closely related species in the Tetranychus genus and cant be reliably distinguished in the field. However, there is little need to do so, since their damage, biology, and management are virtually the same. To the naked eye, spider mites look like tiny, moving dots; however, you can see them easily with a 10X hand lens. Adult females, the largest forms, are less than 1/20 inch long. Spider mites live in colonies, mostly on the undersurfaces of leaves; a single colony may contain hundreds of individuals (Figure 2). The names spider mite and webspinning mite come from the silk webbing most species produce on infested leaves (Figure 3). The presence of webbing is an easy way to distinguish them from all other types of mites and small insects such as aphids and thrips, which can also infest leaf undersides. Adult mites have eight legs and an oval body with two red eyespots near the head end. Females usually have a large, dark blotch on each side of the body and numerous bristles covering the legs and body. Immatures resemble adults (except they are much smaller), and the newly hatched larvae have only six legs. The other immature stages have eight legs. Eggs are spherical and translucent, like tiny droplets, becoming cream colored before hatching (Figure 4).',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'In some parts of California, spider mites may feed and reproduce all year on plants that retain their green leaves throughout the winter. In colder areas and on deciduous trees that drop their leaves, webspinning mites overwinter as red or orange mated females under rough bark scales and in ground litter and trash. They begin feeding and laying eggs when warm weather returns in spring. Spider mites reproduce rapidly in hot weather and commonly become numerous in June through September. If the temperature and food supplies are favorable, a generation can be completed in less than a week (Figure 5). Spider mites prefer hot, dusty conditions and usually are first found on trees or plants adjacent to dusty roadways or at margins of gardens. Plants under water stress also are highly susceptible. As foliage quality declines on heavily infested plants, female mites catch wind currents and disperse to other plants. High mite populations may undergo a rapid decline in late summer when predators overtake them, host plant conditions become unfavorable, and the weather turns cooler as well as following rain.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Mites cause damage by sucking cell contents from leaves. A small number of mites usually isnt reason for concern, but very high populationslevels high enough to show visible damage to leavescan damage plants, especially herbaceous ones. At first, the damage shows up as a stippling of light dots on the leaves; sometimes the leaves take on a bronze color. As feeding continues, the leaves turn yellowish or reddish and drop off. Often, large amounts of webbing cover leaves, twigs, and fruit. Damage is usually worse when compounded by water stress. Loss of leaves wont cause yield losses in fruit trees during the year of infestation unless it occurs in spring or very early summer, but it may impact next years crop. On annual vegetable cropssuch as squash, melons, and watermelonsloss of leaves can have a significant impact on yield and lead to sunburning. On crops such as sugar peas and beans, where pods are attacked, spider mites can cause direct damage. On ornamentals, mites are primarily an aesthetic concern, but they can kill plants if populations become very high on annual plants. Spider mites are also important pests of field-grown roses.',\n",
       "       'management': 'Spider mites have many natural enemies that often limit populations. Adequate irrigation is important, because water-stressed plants are most likely to be damaged. Broad-spectrum insecticide treatments for other pests frequently cause mite outbreaks, so avoid these pesticides when possible. Sprays of water, insecticidal oils, or soaps can be used for management. Always monitor mite levels before treatment. Monitoring Mites are tiny and difficult to detect. Youll usually notice plant damage such as stippled or yellow leaves before you spot the mites themselves (Figure 6). Check the undersides of leaves for mites, their eggs, and webbing; youll need a hand lens to identify them. To observe mites more closely, shake a few off the leaf surface onto a white sheet of paper. Once disturbed, they will move around rapidly. Be sure mites are present before you treat. Sometimes the mites will be gone by the time you notice the damage; plants will often recover after mites have left. Biological Control Spider mites have many natural enemies, which limit their numbers in many landscapes and gardens, especially when undisturbed by pesticide sprays. Some of the most important are the predatory mites, including the western predatory mite (Figure 7), Galendromus (formerly Metaseiulus) occidentalis, and Phytoseiulus mite species. Predatory mites are about the same size as plant-feeding mites but have longer legs and are more active; they also are more teardrop-shaped than spider mites. Various other insects are also important predatorssixspotted thrips (Scolothrips sexmaculatus) (Figure 8), the larvae and adults of the spider mite destroyer lady beetle (Stethorus picipes), the larvae of certain flies including the cecidomyid Feltiella acarivora (Figure 9), and various general predators such as minute pirate bugs, bigeyed bugs, and lacewing larvae. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, can be an important predator on spider mite eggs and larvae, but this species will also inflict severe damage to plants if mites arent present on which to feed. The purchase and release of predatory mites can be useful in establishing populations in large plantings or orchards, but the best results are obtained by creating favorable conditions for naturally occurring predators, such as avoiding dusty conditions and insecticide sprays. The major predator mites commercially available for release are the western predatory mite and Phytoseiulus. The western predatory mite is more effective under hot, dry conditions. These predators dont feed on foliage or become pests; thus if pest mites arent available when predatory mites are released, the predators starve or migrate elsewhere. If you wish to establish predators in a heavily infested orchard or garden that has few predators, use a soap spray or selective miticide to bring pest mites to a lower level and then release predatory mites. A good guideline is that one predator is needed for every 10 spider mites to provide control. More than one application of predatory mites may be required if you want to reduce pest populations rapidly. Concentrate releases in hot spots where spider mite numbers are highest. Once established on perennials, predatory mites may reproduce and provide biological control indefinitely without further augmentation unless nonselective insecticides are applied that kill the predators. Cultural Control Cultural practices can have a significant impact on spider mites. Dusty conditions often lead to mite outbreaks. Apply water to pathways and other dusty areas at regular intervals. Water-stressed trees and plants are less tolerant of spider mite damage. Be sure to provide adequate irrigation. Midseason washing of trees and vines with water to remove dust may help prevent serious late-season mite infestations. In gardens and on small fruit trees, regular, forceful spraying of plants with water often will reduce spider mite numbers adequately. Be sure to get good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. If more control is required, use an insecticidal soap or oil in your spray, but test the product on one or two plants to be sure it isnt damaging to them. (See Chemical Control below.) Chemical Control Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying insecticides. Such outbreaks are commonly a result of the insecticide killing off the mites natural enemies but also occur when certain insecticides stimulate mite reproduction. For example, spider mites exposed to carbaryl (Sevin) in the laboratory have been shown to reproduce faster than untreated populations. Carbaryl, some organophosphates, and some pyrethroids apparently also favor spider mites by increasing the level of nitrogen in leaves. Insecticides applied during hot weather usually appear to have the greatest effect, causing dramatic spider mite outbreaks within a few days. If a treatment for mites is necessary, use selective materials, preferably insecticidal soap or insecticidal oil. Both petroleum-based horticultural oils and plant-based oils such as neem, canola, or cottonseed oils are acceptable. There are also a number of plant extracts formulated as acaricides (a pesticide that kills mites) that exert an effect on spider mites. These include garlic extract, clove oil, mint oils, rosemary oil, cinnamon oil and others. Dont use soaps or oils on water-stressed plants or when temperatures exceed 90F. These materials may injure some plants, so check labels and/or test them out on a portion of the foliage several days before applying a full treatment. Oils and soaps must contact mites to kill them, so excellent coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, is essential, and repeat applications may be required. Sulfur sprays can be used on some vegetables, fruit trees, and ornamentals. This product will burn cucurbits and other plants in some cases. Dont use sulfur unless it has been shown to be safe for that plant in your locality. Use liquid products such as sulfur and potash soap combinations (e.g., Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray) rather than sulfur dusts, which drift easily and can be breathed in. Dont use sulfur if temperatures exceed 90F, and dont apply sulfur within 30 days of an oil spray. Sulfur is a skin irritant and eye and respiratory hazard, so always wear appropriate protective clothing.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'There are two species of widow spiders in California, the western black widow and the brown widow. Both are in the genus Latrodectus and are characterized by a similar body shape, reclusive habit, and irregular cobwebs. The western black widow, a native species, is widespread, and is the spider posing the greatest potential envenomation threat to humans in the western United States. It is well known in many localities, and nonprofessionals can identify it easily. In the first decade of the 21st century, the non-native brown widow became established in southern California. Although it isn\\'t nearly as dangerous as the black widow, it causes alarm because of the reputation of its relative. BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS Several species of black widow are common in North America, but in the western United States the only species present is the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus. Its habitat ranges from British Columbia and Alberta to Mexico and throughout the Rocky Mountains to the western portions of the Great Plains. In California, it is a common desert spider that can survive very hot, dry conditions. However, black widows also can be found in mountainous terrain above 5,000-foot elevation in Southern California, where snow covers the ground every winter. Outside California, western black widows are common in urban Colorado, in central and eastern Washington state, and in southern British Columbia. Because the holes, cracks, crevices, trash, and clutter associated with human structures provide ideal habitat for the western black widow, these spiders are often very common around homes, barns, outbuildings, and rock walls. In such supportive habitats, mature females can be found every few feet and sometimes within inches of each other. Identification A mature female western black widow spider is about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in body length, and has a rounded abdomen and very characteristic coloration. She is shiny jet black all over her body and legs, except for a red pattern on the underside of the abdomen, which looks, in perfect specimens, like an hourglass. Some specimens have a brownish or plum-colored tinge, but usually these are females that are so well fed that the black-pigmented abdomen has been stretched until it looks brown instead of black. The red hourglass varies in appearance; it can be two perfect triangles with points merged to make a perfect hourglass, two triangles separated by a space, a triangle and a small bar, minimal or almost imperceptible red coloration, or, on rare occasions, completely absent. The false black widow, which is discussed below, is chocolate brown and never has red coloration, although many people frequently mistake it for a black widow. As easy as it is to identify an adult female black widow, the immatures, looking nothing like the mother, can be difficult to recognize. When black widow spiderlings emerge from their egg sac, they have tan legs and a tan cephalothorax (the body part to which the legs attach), while the abdomen is mostly white with a few black spots. As the spider grows, the background coloration of the abdomen becomes olive-gray or tan; and there is a longitudinal white stripe on the top of the abdomen and diagonal stripes on the flanks, with a small black dot at the uppermost portion of each diagonal stripe. As the spiderlings continue to grow larger, they molt, like all spiders, in order to shed their restrictive exoskeletons. With successive molts in females, the white stripes become thinner, the olive-gray or tan coloration darkens toward black, and eventually the spider acquires its well-known black coloration. Some mature females retain one or two conspicuous, indented white lines on the front surface of the abdomen that look like a corporal\\'s chevrons. In the youngest spiders, the space where the hourglass develops starts off being a whitish shield. As the spider grows and molts several times, the color of this shield turns from white-yellow to orange-red and changes from a shield with a thick middle portion to an hourglass with a thin, tapered middle. In contrast to the female, the male black widow retains the coloration of the juvenile. After it matures, it stops eating and its abdomen shrinks (its only task at this point is to mate). The male still retains one longitudinal abdominal stripe and a set of diagonal flank stripes on each side of the abdomen. The males are much smaller than the females in body length, although sometimes their legs are almost as long as those of the adult female. Egg Sac The egg sac of the western black widow is yellowish and teardrop-shaped, tapered at the top and bulbous at the bottom. The margins of the sac are well defined (as opposed to some spider egg sacs, which look like fluffy cotton balls, making it difficult to determine exactly where the egg sac starts). The egg sac covering is very tough and difficult to rip apart. A female western black widow typically lays about 300 eggs per sac. Because females can store sperm from their only mating, they can produce more than 10 egg sacs without subsequent matings and without a decrease in the number of eggs or a reduction in the percentage of eggs that will successfully hatch into spiderlings. Habitat The western black widow is found in populated areas almost everywhere in California. Although they can be found in homes, black widows typically nest outside, around the home in holes and crevices, and within clutter. In garages, they usually make webs by doors, near vents, and in other places where insects may pass by. Because most people don\\'t tolerate large numbers of insects in their living spaces, widow spiders usually won\\'t find sufficient prey to survive inside homes. Black widows are shy spiders that seek retreats, such as holes between bricks or spaces around pipe penetrations in walls, where they can hide during the day and then come out at night. In natural settings, you can often find them in rodent burrows and crevices in rock faces. The spider makes a web of tangled silk extending from this retreat hole. The web doesn\\'t have a very recognizable pattern, although it does have vertical support threads above and below the central areas where the spider sits while it waits for prey at night. The lower support threads also alert the widow to the presence of a prey item blundering into the web. In most cases, a widow spider will seek a retreat near the ground as the home base for her web, which connects to the retreat, allowing the spider to emerge to catch both flying and crawling prey at night, usually within three feet of the ground. However, some spiders will make a retreat well above ground level, such as in the eave of a house, and then drop down 10 or more feet before building their web. Widow spiders come out at dusk. After making improvements to their existing web, they take up a position in the middle, their underside facing upward, to wait for prey. Any large disturbance of the web that indicates something larger than a prey item causes the spider to quickly move toward the safety of its retreat. The silk of a mature black widow is very strong. If you run your finger through the web of a large spider, the result is an audible ripping sound. Black widow silk is so strong that during World War II, it was used to make crosshairs for gun sights. Medical Aspects Bites from black widow spiders are quite rare, even where these spiders are very common. In the unlikely event of an actual bite from a black widow, the bite itself is painless or may feel like a little pinprick. Almost all medically important black widow bites are from the adult female, which is much larger than the male. The female also has stronger biting muscles and a larger venom reserve. At the site of the bite, there may be a little red mark or red streaking away from the bite. Within an hour, other symptoms may start to appear. Bite victims might suffer from some but not all of the following symptoms: Rigid stomach muscles, which some medical professionals have misdiagnosed as appendicitis Sweating, sometimes of just the bitten body part, such as a bite to the hand that results in only the arm sweating profusely Pain that can be local, radiating, or regional Urine retention Numbness, agitation, fever, and patchy paralysis (less common) Another sign of envenomation is that bite victims will sometimes move or rock back and forth incessantly to try to lessen the pain from the venom injection process. Although these are the most severe manifestations of black widow bites, symptoms most often merely resemble those of the flu. Black widow bites don\\'t cause conspicuous swelling, necrosis, or deterioration of tissue around the bite. As a neurotoxin, the venom of a black widow affects the nerve-muscle junction in the body. Normally, the body\\'s neurons work like a light switch: they make the muscle turn on and then off again so that the muscle can relax and be ready to contract again if needed. The venom causes the muscle to repeatedly contract. It would be like flipping on a light switch and not being able to turn it off again. If bitten, seek medical attention immediately. You can place a cold pack on the bite to relieve the pain. An antivenom for black widow bites is available that works for all species that have been tested worldwide. Response is fast, and bite victims can go from intense pain back to normal in 30 minutes. The antivenom is based on horse serum, so physicians need to monitor for anaphylactic shock. American physicians are somewhat reluctant to use antivenom for this reason and might prefer to have the bite victim simply endure the symptoms, which can be similar to those of a bad flu episode and usually dissipate in a few days. BROWN WIDOW SPIDERS The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is found worldwide in subtropical habitats. It probably originated from Africa, or possibly from South America. In North America, the brown widow was found only in Florida for many decades, where it remains rather common. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the spider began appearing elsewhere, from Texas throughout the Gulf Coast states and up the Atlantic coast into South Carolina. While they were expanding in the southeastern United States, brown widows started being discovered in great numbers in Southern California, where they have caused great concern within the general public. Initial news reports exaggerated the impact of the brown widow. However, unlike that of the black widow, the bite of this spider is not much more toxic to humans than that of other common spiders. Identification Mature female brown widows are smaller than mature female western black widows, being about 3/8\" in body length (10 mm). The normal brown widow spider coloration is a mottled collection of tan, brown, and gray. It has a lengthwise stripe halfway up the back side of the abdomen with two isolated dots in front of it and diagonal stripes on the side, somewhat similar to immature western black widow spiders (see Table 1). However, the usual background coloration of the brown widow is more of a tan, as compared to the western black widow, in which background coloration is more olive-gray. Male brown widows are much smaller [body length: 3/16 inch (4 to 5 mm)] than other widow spiders and therefore might be overlooked or misidentified. There is, however, great variation in brown widow coloration. Spiders can vary from almost white to almost black. When brown widows are very dark, though, this coloration is closer to a flat black than a shiny black like that of a mature black widow female. A mature brown widow female looks very similar to an immature western black widow, thus some skill is needed to identify the two accurately. However, the brown widow egg sac, as described in the next paragraph, is distinctive and a much surer way to confirm the species. Table 1. Features used to distinguish brown widows from immature western black widows. Feature Brown widow Black widow (immature) Black spots on lateral abdominal stripes large, squarish small, elliptical Hourglass bottom half larger top half larger rough margins crisp, straight margins White markings on front of abdomen not continuous continuous Egg Sac The egg sac of the brown widow spider has protuberances of silk all over its surface, resembling a very large pollen grain. The sac is so characteristic that it can be used to verify the presence of brown widows even if the spiders themselves are not seen. Brown widows produce about 130 eggs per egg sac and are able to make 20 or more egg sacs in a lifetime, sometimes multiple sacs within a short time period. Female brown widows can be collected with several simultaneously-developing egg sacs. Habitat The habitat of the brown widow is similar in many respects to that of the black widow. They generally reside in cluttered areas outside, such as woodpiles, but you will also find them in more exposed areas, such as on chain-link fences where black widows normally would not be found. They are also extremely common in the nooks and crannies on the undersides of inexpensive plastic patio furniture. Brown widow spiders make irregular webs of strong silk, similar to those of western black widows. Both black widows and brown widows are almost never found in homes. In garages, black widows are common but brown widows are not. Outside and around the home, both spiders are very common. The brown widow appears to be displacing the black widow in some of its habitats, especially in urban areas. Southern California residents frequently mention that they used to have a few black widows, but now only can find brown widows (and in greater numbers). In a study published in 2012, brown widows outnumbered black widows in urban areas; such as around homes, in parks (especially under playground equipment), in zoos, etc. The same study, however, reported that brown widows were not found in natural areas in southern California (such as in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat) and were rare around agricultural buildings. Brown widows were occasionally found in agricultural crops such as citrus, apple, and avocado trees as well as in corn stalks, bird-of-paradise leaves and other plants, but most of these finds were in vegetation associated with small home gardens rather than large commercial properties. As of 2016, brown widows were well established from Santa Barbara to the San Bernardino area and south to Mexico. Established populations have not yet been found north of the Los Angeles Basin, in the Central Valley, or in the desert areas (which may be inhospitable for them due to the arid climate). Although unsubstantiated reports of brown widows occurring north of the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara region (such as in the San Francisco Bay area) have been made for years, submitted spiders have been immature black widows, Steatoda (false black widow) spiders of several species, or orbweavers. However, it is possible that the brown widow is continuing to expand its range in California. Medical Aspects The bite of the brown widow is much milder than that of the western black widow. In a study in Africa, the most common symptoms in 15 verified bites were that the bite hurt when it happened and that there was burning pain at the bite site. None of these patients developed the typical dynamic symptoms of black widow envenomation. Despite these observations, there is one American record of a verified bite where the patient developed more severe symptoms and required hospitalization. Although its venom is at least as potent as black widow venom (drop for drop, as tested in mice), the brown widow is smaller and likely injects much less venom during a bite. In addition, bites to people are unlikely since brown widows, when disturbed, typically pull their legs close to the body, drop from their web, and play dead. The recent arrival of the brown widow in Southern California is not a cause for alarm. In fact, if the brown widow is indeed displacing the more toxic black widow, there actually might be a reduction in spider bite risk as compared to previous decades. OTHER RELATED SPIDERS False Black Widow The false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, is not a true widow spider; however, it is in the same family, Theridiidae, as widow spiders and can easily be confused with them. It shares the same rounded-abdomen body form and web-making traits. It is slightly smaller than a mature western black widow spider [body length: 3/8 inch (10 mm)], chocolate brown in color, and never has red coloration on its belly. The false black widow is a European immigrant that has become extremely common in Pacific Coast homes from San Diego to British Columbia, with isolated finds in Alaska. Unlike black widows, false black widow spiders thrive indoors, especially in washrooms, inside cupboards and underneath appliances, furniture and cabinets. False black widows make an egg sac that looks like a cotton ball with indistinct margins. Unlike black widow spiders, false black widow spiderlings are dark like their mothers when they emerge. Because they are common in homes, false black widows are more frequently involved in bite incidents than black widow or brown widow spiders. They have mild venom, and bites may cause symptoms similar to those of yellowjacket wasp stings: initial burning pain followed by minor localized swelling around the envenomation site. When black widow antivenom mistakenly has been used on false black widow bites, it appeared to eliminate the venom\\'s effects. Noble False Widow Spider In 2011, Steatoda nobilis was discovered in Southern California. Like the false black widow, this spider is a European native. Mature females can reach 5/8 inch (14 mm) in body length, which is significantly larger than the false black widow. Instead of being uniformly colored on the top surface of the abdomen as is the false black widow, Steatoda nobilis usually has a light tan pattern somewhat resembling a house with two windows and a domed roof. However, in some specimens, only the remnant tip of the \"roof\" is exhibited. There is also a broad, tan band on the front-facing surface of the abdomen. This spider was first found in Ventura County. It is now widespread in coastal San Diego County, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay area. Isolated finds have occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Bites from this species are not considered to be medically significant. There have been two recorded bites from the spider, with minor symptom development, but because of its large size, it has the potential to hurt merely from fang penetration. This spider will probably continue to spread throughout coastal California.',\n",

       "       'management': \"Minimizing sites around the home where spiders may hide, such as clutter, woodpiles, and heavy ground cover, is essential for reducing widow spider populations. However, it is not practical to eliminate these spiders completely. Both widow species will continue to re-infest treated areas. Regularly vacuuming or sweeping windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, and other seldom-used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually don't survive this process. In the garage, keep items such as gardening clothes and gloves in bags closed with zipper-locks or twist ties. Store seasonal items such as sports gear, camping gear, winter clothes or holiday decorations in boxes that can be taped shut and placed off the floor away from walls in order to exclude spiders. When cleaning up clutter in garages and other storage areas, be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Other areas to check carefully include children's toys or playhouses made of molded plastic that have open spaces facing downward where spiders can crawl in. Additional favored habitats of widow spiders include picnic tables, trash can grips, lawn chairs, plant pots with curled lips, and other outdoor objects with sheltered lips or crevices. Be careful that you do not carry spiders indoors on items such as plants, firewood, and boxes. Stack woodpiles away from your house, and never pick up pieces of wood unless you are wearing gloves. Eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping areas near building foundations free of trash, leaf litter, and accumulations of other materials. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attract spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures pointed off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides do not provide long-term control. Because widow spiders are nocturnal, a nonchemical method of eradication is to search for them at night with a flashlight and kill them with a shoe or rolled up newspaper. If you are concerned about wildlife and feel comfortable doing so, you can remove individual spiders from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper underneath to seal off the opening when you lift the jar. Release the spider about 100 feet from your home into a natural area. Brown widows may not survive in natural areas but on the other hand, they are an invasive, non-native pest species and should not be there anyway. One aspect that makes controlling widow spiders difficult is that they, like many spiders, exhibit a behavior called ballooning. When the spiderlings are very small, on warm days when there is an updraft, they climb to the top of a fence post or piece of vegetation, raise their abdomens into the air, and release a small filament of silk. When the updraft currents overtake the forces of gravity, the spiderling is carried into the air to another location. This may only be a few feet away, or it could be miles. Ballooning spiderlings have been captured at 10,000 feet from the ground and 200 miles offshore. Because spiderlings will be dropping down on your property continually, eliminating them will be a task that needs to be done repeatedly throughout the year. Chemical Control Typically, control of spiders using pesticides is difficult. Various insecticides are registered for control of spiders; including pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and combinations of these products. Curiously, most of these registered pesticides are water-based while the silk of spider egg sacs repels water. In a 2016 study, water-based insecticides sprayed on brown widow egg sacs provided no significant effect on the egg contents. However, when petroleum-based products were used, the pesticide was readily carried past the silk outer layer and killed the egg sac contents.\"},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Protect spiders in your garden because they prey on insects and other pests. Most spiders observed in the open during the day are not likely to bite you or cause lasting harm if they do bite you. Spiders whose bites might require you to seek medical attention spend most of their time hidden. Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have 8 legs and 2 body partsan abdomen and a combined head and thorax. They lack wings and antennae. Spider families vary by body shape, web type, hunting or other behavior, and the arrangement and relative size of their eyes. Cellar spiders have long, skinny legs and hang upside down in dark corners, often indoors, sometimes bouncing when disturbed. The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, is shown here. Cobweb spiders hang upside down in sticky, irregularly spun webs waiting for prey. Most cobweb species are small and harmless, such as this Theridion dilutum. Western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most well-known cobweb spider. Most black widow bites come from mature adult females (left), which can usually be recognized by a red hourglass on the underside of the abdomen. The adult male (right) is lighter-colored and smaller than the female. Crab or flower spiders, such as Misumena vatia, have enlarged front legs. They hunt during the day without webs. Dwarf spiders are tiny, hunt during the day, and produce sheetlike or irregular crisscross webs on surfaces. Funnel weavers spin thick, flattened webs and sit at the center of a silken hole, or funnel, running out to capture prey that contact the web. Often seen are Hololena nedra (left) and the common house spider, Tegenaria species, (right) found in gardens and on walls and ceilings inside the house. Lynx spiders are active hunters that stalk and capture prey. Legs are spiny, and the abdomen is narrowest at the rear. They dont spin webs. Shown here is a green lynx spider, Peucetia viridans . Jumping spiders hunt during the day, stalking and pouncing on prey. They are hairy, sometimes iridescent, and dont spin webs. This Phidippus species is eating a house fly. Orb weaver or garden spiders, such as this western spotted orb weaver, Neoscona oaxacensis, (left) often are large and colorful and wait in their webs or nearby for prey to become entangled. They spin elaborate webs in concentric circles in the garden. Sac spiders hide in silk tubes in places such as corners, beneath plants, or on bark, and stalk prey at night. They occur indoors and out and usually are pale, such as this agrarian sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum. Wolf spiders have long, hairy legs and are often found running along the ground. They dont build webs to capture prey but can have a silken retreat. Females carry young on their backs.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Spider mites are common pests of fruit trees, vegetables, berries, vines, and ornamental plants. Mites are tiny and difficult to see. Although related to insects, mites are arachnids just like spiders and ticks. If leaves are stippled with white dots or have webbing, check the undersides to see if spider mites are present. Sprays of water, insecticidal oils, or soaps can be used for management. Spider mites have many naturally occurring predators that often limit their numbers. What to look for: To the naked eye, spider mites look like tiny, moving dots. Use a magnifying lens to see them. Adults are less than 120 inch long and have eight legs, an oval body, and two colored eyespots near the end of the head. Spider mites live in colonies, mostly on the under surfaces of leaves; a single colony can contain hundreds of mites. When numbers are high, dense webbing can cover leaves, twigs, and fruit. Mites cause damage by sucking cell contents from leaves. A small number of mites isnt usually cause for concern, but very high populations can be damaging, especially to annual plants. Often, damage first appears as a stippling of light dots on the leaves; sometimes leaves turn a bronze color. Heavily infested leaves can turn yellow and drop off. Damage is usually most severe in hot, dusty conditions and on water-stressed plants. Protect predators of spider mites. Spider mites have many predators or natural enemies, which prevent them from becoming plant pests, especially when undisturbed by pesticide sprays. Key predators include predatory mites, which are about the same size as plant-feeding mites but have longer legs and are more active. Other common natural enemies include thrips, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Keep dust down. Plant ground covers, use mulches, and irrigate regularly. Avoid using insecticides that kill natural enemies. How do I control spider mites? Water plants sufficiently to avoid drought stress, which increases mites and mite damage. Most woody plants can tolerate low to moderate mite populations, and natural enemies are often abundant. If plants are infested, apply a water spray or mist to the undersides of leaves at least once a day. If you wish to use an insecticide, a good choice is an insecticidal oil or soap (or a combination of the two) applied so you completely cover the undersides of leaves. Be sure mites are present before treating. Dont spray when plants are water-stressed or if it is very hot. Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying persistent insecticides such as carbaryl or pyrethroids. These insecticides are not very effective against mites and often kill off natural enemies and stimulate mite reproduction. What about pesticides? If an insecticide is needed, use an insecticidal oil or insecticidal soap (or a combination of the two), applied so you completely cover the undersides of leaves. Be sure mites are present before treating. Dont spray when plants are water-stressed or if it is very hot. Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying persistent insecticides such as carbaryl or pyrethroids.

For some gardeners, this intensive management may include the application of pesticides to manage insects and mites. Other enthusiasts can maintain vigorous plants and produce high quality blooms with little or no use of insecticides. The keys to avoiding pest problems are careful selection of varieties (which vary significantly in susceptibility to insect and disease problems), good attention to appropriate cultural practices, and occasional handpicking or water sprays to remove pests. Regularly monitor for pests and keep an eye out for rising populations of the natural enemies that often rapidly reduce the numbers of aphids, mites, and other pests. For management of diseases see Pest Notes: Roses: Diseases and Abiotic Disorders, and for general tips on cultural practices and weed control, see Pest Notes: Roses: Cultural Practices and Weed Control.',\n",

       "       'development': \"Aphids. Aphids are the most common insect pests on roses. Species include the rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae, the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, and the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, among others. Aphids favor rapidly growing tissue such as buds and shoots. Low to moderate levels of aphids do little damage to plants, although some gardeners may be concerned by their very presence. Moderate to high populations can secrete copious amounts of honeydew, resulting in the growth of sooty mold, which blackens leaves. Very high numbers of aphids may distort or kill buds or reduce flower size. In most areas of California aphids are only considered a major problem for about 6 weeks in spring and early summer before high summer temperatures reduce their numbers. Aphids have many natural enemies including parasitic wasps, lady beetles, soldier beetles, and syrphid flies (see the section on Common Natural Enemies) that may rapidly reduce increasing populations. Ants protect aphids from natural enemies, so keeping them out of bushes with sticky barriers, baits, or traps may improve biological control. Lady beetles often increase in number when aphid populations are high. The convergent lady beetle is sold at nurseries for release against aphids and may provide limited control when properly released. For more information on how to release them see UC IPMs convergent lady beetle page in the Natural Enemies Gallery. Releasing green lacewings against the rose aphid has not been shown to offer significant control in research trials. A naturally occurring fungal disease may control aphids when conditions are wet or humid. In many landscape situations, knocking aphids off with a forceful stream or spray of water early in the day is all that is needed to supplement natural control. Insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils (including neem oil) can also be used to suppress aphids with only moderate impact on natural enemies. Soil-applied systemic insecticides, such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, are effective but are not usually necessary and may harm pollinators and natural enemies. Use of broadly toxic insecticides is not warranted in most gardens and landscapes. For more information on aphids see Pest Notes: Aphids . Insects and Mites that Cause Leaves to Stipple or Yellow Spider mites, including twospotted spider mite, Pacific spider mite, and strawberry spider mite, all in the genus Tetranychus, feed on foliage, causing leaves to become stippled or bleached, and may cause leaves to dry up and fall. Some species produce webbing while others do not. Spider mites are tiny (about the size of the period at the end of this sentence) and are best seen with a magnifier. Mites usually appear first on the undersides of leaves but may move to the upper surfaces as populations increase. High numbers are usually associated with dry, dusty conditions. Spider mite numbers may greatly increase if their many natural enemies are killed by broad-spectrum insecticides applied against other pests. For instance, applications of carbaryl or pyrethroid insecticides (such as cyfluthrin and permethrin) to control insect pests are frequently followed by an increase in mite populations. Conserving natural enemies, providing sufficient irrigation, and reducing dust may all help control mites. Overhead irrigation or periodic washing of leaves with water can be very effective in reducing mite numbers. If chemical treatment is necessary, spider mites can be controlled with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, and sprays should be targeted to ensure coverage of the undersides of the leaves. Although spider mites may be listed on many insecticide labels, most insecticides are not very effective against them and can actually trigger mite flare-ups as mentioned above. For more information about spider mites, see Pest Notes: Spider Mites . Rose leafhopper, Edwardsiana rosae, causes stippling damage that appears larger than mite stippling. Along with stippling, cast skins and the absence of webbing on the underside of leaves are good indications that leafhoppers are present. Leafhoppers are not common problems in most areas; be sure to check for the insects themselves if suspect stippling is observed. Plants can tolerate moderate stippling. Knock leafhoppers off with a water spray or use an insecticidal soap on nymphs if an infestation is severe. Insects that Distort or Discolor Blossoms Thrips. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, and madrone thrips, Thrips madroni, primarily cause injury to rose flowers, causing blossom petals to streak with brown or become distorted. Damage may be severe if flowers are attacked early at the bud stage. The tiny yellow or black thrips insects can be found within the blossoms. In August 2015, a new species of thrips, the chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis, was found infesting roses in southern California. This species, which is native to Asia and about the size of western flower thrips, can severely distort plant growth. This species may be found on leaves, leaf litter, on the axils of leaves, in curled leaves, and under the calyxes of flowers. Chilli thrips has a broad host range and, because of its habit of attacking leaves as well as flowers, has the potential to cause much more serious damage than other thrips species. Thrips problems are more likely to be severe where many rose plants grown close together provide a continuously blooming habitat. Fragrant, light-colored, and white roses are most often attacked and can be severely damaged. Cultivars with sepals that remain tightly wrapped around the bud until blooms open have fewer thrips problems. In most home garden and landscape situations, thrips can be tolerated. Frequent clipping and prompt disposal of spent blooms may reduce thrips problems. Control with insecticides is difficult because products are most effective on developing thrips, which usually feed deep within buds or flowers where pesticide applications cannot reach. It should be noted that western flower thrips can sometimes be considered beneficial because they are predators of spider mites. Insects that Chew Blossoms and/or Leaves Fuller rose beetle. Adults of Fuller rose beetle, Naupactus godmani, chew flowers and foliage leaving notched or ragged edges. Adult beetles are pale brown weevils that are about 3/8 inch long. They are flightless and hide during the day, often on the undersides of leaves. Feeding takes place at night. The larvae are root feeders but do not seriously damage roses. Low numbers can be ignored. Otherwise, handpick the beetles off plants, use sticky material on stems to trap and exclude them, and trim any branches touching walls, fences, or other plants. In California, adults emerge from June to November and are difficult to control with insecticides. Parasitic nematodes, which attack larvae, may be helpful if applied to the soil in early to midsummer. Hoplia beetle, Hoplia callipyge, is about 1/4 inch long and chews holes mostly in the petals of open flowers. It is primarily a problem in the Central Valley from Sacramento south to Bakersfield. The hoplia beetle prefers feeding on flowers of light-colored roses (white, pink, apricot, and yellow) and does not damage leaves. Larvae are root feeders but do not feed on the roots of rose plants. There is only one generation a year and damage is usually confined to the 2- to 4-week period in late spring when adults are active. Adult hoplia beetles can be handpicked or infested rose blooms removed. Insecticide sprays are not very effective and should not be necessary in a garden situation. For more information about hoplia beetle, see Pest Notes: Hoplia Beetle . Hoplia beetles may be mistaken for Japanese beetles, Popillia japonica, serious pests in other areas of the United States, but Japanese beetles are about twice as long and are metallic green with coppery wing covers. Japanese beetles are not established in California. If you believe you have found a Japanese beetle in your landscape, contact the California Department of Food and Agriculture Hotline (1-800-491-1899; also see cdfa.ca.gov/plant/JB/). Leafcutting bees, Megachile spp., cut semicircular holes in the margins of leaves and carry leaf material back to use in lining their nests. Bees are important pollinators and should not be killed. There are no effective controls. Rose curculio, Merhynchites bicolor ., is a reddish-black snout weevil about 1/4 inch long that prefers yellow and white roses. Adults feed by drilling holes in flower buds that may kill the developing bud or result in ragged holes in blossoms when they open. If weevils are numerous, terminal shoots may be killed as well. Eggs are laid inside buds and larvae feed within, often killing buds before they open. When mature, larvae drop to the ground to overwinter and pupate in the soil, emerging as adults in spring. There is only one generation a year. Hand pick adults off plants and destroy buds infested with larvae. Many beetles may be removed from heavily infested bushes by gently shaking plants over a bucket of soapy water. A broad-spectrum insecticide can be applied to kill adults if the infestation is severe. Caterpillars such as orange tortrix, tussock moth, fruittree leafroller, tent caterpillar, and omnivorous looper may feed on rose leaves, flowers and buds . Some of these caterpillars may also tie leaves together with silk. Some caterpillars, like the tobacco budworm, may bore into flower buds. Look for the caterpillar or its frass inside. Hand pick caterpillars or prune out and promptly dispose of infested buds or rolled leaves (often hiding caterpillars within). Damage is usually not severe and treatment with pesticides not generally necessary. Leaf-feeding caterpillars can be reduced with the microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis or the insecticide spinosad. These materials will be most effective when caterpillars are small, and caterpillars within buds are unlikely to be killed. Damage may not be noticed until after caterpillars are full grown and no longer vulnerable to insecticide applications. Roseslugs include several species of sawflies that damage leaves on roses. Sawflies are wasps with plant-feeding larvae that resemble caterpillars. Young larvae skeletonize lower leaf surfaces while mature larvae chew large holes in leaves. Roseslugs have many natural enemies that help keep their populations down. They may be washed off plants with strong streams of water or killed with insecticidal soap, horticultural oil, or spinosad. Insecticides containing Bacillus thuringiensis are not effective against roseslugs because they are not the larvae of butterflies or moths. Insects that Cause Canes to Die Back Flatheaded borers, Chrysobothris spp., may kill canes or entire plants. Larvae are white and up to 1 inch long with enlarged heads. Adult beetles do not significantly damage roses. Eggs tend to be laid on stressed rose plants, especially in bark wounds caused by sunburn or disease. Remove and destroy infested plant material and keep plants healthy by providing sufficient irrigation and avoiding excessive summer pruning. Raspberry horntail larvae, Hartigia cressoni, are white, segmented larvae up to 1 inch long that feed within rose stems or canes. Adults are black or black and yellow wood wasps about 1/2 inch long. In the spring, horntail feeding can cause tips of canes to wilt and die, reducing second-cycle rose blooms. Inspect canes in spring (mid-April to mid-June) for egg-laying incisions or swellings caused by larvae feeding within and cut them off below the infestation. Prune down infested canes until a healthy cross section is found. Scale insects that may attack roses include two species of armored scales: the rose scale, Aulacaspis rosae, and the San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus . These pests may cause cane decline or dieback when numbers are high. San Jose scale may spread by wind from nearby orchards, and so may be found on roses near urban-agricultural interfaces in California's Central Valley and other fruit or nut tree production areas. Armored scales can be observed on canes as small, grayish, round to oval encrustations, ranging in size from 1/8 to 1/4 inch. These insects have no legs or antennae for most of their lives and are immobile. In winter, cut back and destroy infested canes and apply insecticidal oil to any remaining infested canes if the scale population is high. Scales are attacked by many natural enemies. Look for exit holes in mature scale covers, indicating parasitization. Other scale insects, including cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi, and several species of soft scales such as black scale, Saissetia oleae, may also be found on roses. These insects produce honeydew, which may cause leaves to be sticky and will allow black sooty mold to colonize leaf surfaces. Washing plants with soap and water may reduce populations. Pruning and application of horticultural oil in winter for armored scales should provide sufficient control. For more information about scale insects, see Pest Notes: Scales . Insects Seldom Found in California Roses Mossy rose galls, created by the gall wasp Diplolepis rosae, are spherical spined masses of plant tissue about an inch in diameter that form on year-old rose twigs. At first, the deformity resembles moss, but it becomes hardened as it enlarges. Although mossy rose gall is most common, many kinds of galls can form on roses; most caused by different gall wasp species. They may occur on twigs, stems or leaves and have various shapes and textures. Galls are more common in cooler, northern parts of California than in the Central Valley. They are generally not damaging and pruning them out should provide sufficient control. Rose midge, Dasineura rhodophaga, was found infesting roses in a nursery in Petaluma, California, in August 1996; however, it has not been reported in California since. This pest can cause severe damage and is established in Oregon, Washington, and other states, so rose growers should be on the lookout for new infestations, especially when purchasing new plants. Rose midges are tiny flies that lay their eggs inside the sepals of flower buds or on plant terminals. Hatching larvae move into flower buds to feed, leaving the injured buds to wither, blacken, and die. Pupation occurs in the soil and 2 to 4 generations can occur annually. Take any suspected infested material to your county Agricultural Commissioner for identification. Don't confuse the rose midge with the similar looking beneficial midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza, which feeds on aphids. Aphidoletes larvae are found on stem, bud, or leaf surfaces feeding within aphid colonies, whereas Dasineura larvae will be hidden out of view at the bases of developing buds. COMMON NATURAL ENEMIES Aphid parasites. Tiny parasitic wasps are very important in the control of aphids on roses. Adults lay their eggs within the aphid and developing wasp larvae feeding within rapidly immobilize the aphids. Eventually, the parasites kill the aphids and turn them into bronze or black crusty, bloated mummies. The parasitic wasp larva pupates within the mummy and then cuts a neat, round hole and emerges as a full-grown wasp . Once you see one mummy in the aphid colony, you are likely to see more. Parasitic wasps are also important in the control of scale insects, caterpillars, and many other insect pests. Minute pirate bug. Minute pirate bugs, Orius tristicolor, are tiny true bugs with black and white markings as adults. They are often among the first predators to appear in spring, and they feed on mites, insect and mite eggs, immature scales, and thrips. Lacewings. Green lacewings in the genera Chrysopa and Chrysoperla are common natural enemies of aphids and other soft-bodied insects. The gray-green to brown alligator-shaped larvae are the predatory stage. The green lacy-winged adults feed on honeydew. Lady beetles. Many different red and black lady beetle species are predators of aphids; the most common is the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens . Another common species in the garden is the Asian multicolored lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis . These lady beetles feed primarily on aphids and are predators in both the adult and larval stages. Look for the black, alligator-shaped larvae with orange dots and oblong, yellow lady beetle eggs that are laid on end in groups. Releases of commercially available convergent lady beetles can reduce aphid numbers. However, large numbers must be released on each individual rose plant. Mist lady beetles with a water spray before release. Make releases in the evening at dusk by placing beetles on canes at the base of plants. Wet plants first with a fine spray of water. Expect 90% of the lady beetles to fly away in the first 24 hours. The remaining lady beetles are unlikely to lay eggs and will fly away once aphid populations have been substantially reduced. Leatherwings or soldier beetles . These moderate to large-sized beetles in the cantharid family have leatherlike dark wings and orange or red heads and thoraxes. Several species feed on aphids and are very common on roses. Many people mistake soldier beetles for pests, but they can be important predators. Sometimes the beetles, which may feed on pollen and nectar as well as aphids, leave dark splotches of excrement on leaves. Soldier beetle larvae are also predaceous but live in the soil, feeding on soil-dwelling invertebrates. Syrphid flies. In their larval stage, syrphids, sometimes called flower flies or hover flies, are important predators of aphids and are very common on roses. Syrphid adults superficially resemble honey bees or wasps, feed on nectar and pollen before reproducing, and are often seen hovering above flowers. There are many species of hover flies in California. The aphid-feeding larvae, often found within aphid colonies, are legless and maggot-shaped and vary in color from dull brown or yellow to bright green; some species have a stripe down their backs. Don't mistake them for moth or butterfly caterpillars, which have legs and chew holes in leaves. Predaceous mites. A number of predatory mites feed on spider mites, often keeping them at tolerable levels. Predatory mites can be distinguished from the plant-feeding spider mites by the absence of the two spots on either side of the body, their pear shape, and their more active habits. Compared to the plant-feeding species of mites, which remain in one location feeding, predatory mites move rapidly around the leaf when looking for prey. Because they are so small, a hand lens is helpful in viewing them. Thrips . Sixspotted thrips, Eotetranychus sexmaculatus, feeds on spider mites. Western flower thrips are plant feeders but also feed on spider mites. While thrips damage may not be tolerated within commercial production, in landscape settings thrips may provide benefits outweighing the limited damage they cause. Spiders. All spiders are predators and many contribute significantly to biological control. Many types of spiders including crab spiders, jumping spiders, cobweb spiders, and orbweavers occur in landscapes.\",\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'The hobo spider, Eratigena agrestis (formerly Tegenaria agrestis), is a European immigrant that was designated in the 1980s as potentially toxic in the United States. However, subsequent research has questioned the validity of this designation. Today the hobo spider is no longer considered of probable medical importance. The hobo spider does not live in California. There are many cases, however, of common related spiders being misidentified as hobo spiders by the general public and even by pest control operators. In North America, the hobo spider lives in the Pacific Northwest, from British Columbia east to Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado, and south through Oregon and northern Utah. Although once common in Seattle, the hobo spider has been competitively displaced by another European species, the giant house spider, Eratigena atrica, so the hobo spider is now less dominant. The name \"hobo\" is linked to the spiders presumed spread to distant cities via railways. It is conceivable that the hobo spider\\'s range may extend into the northernmost areas of California. However, there have been no documented verifications by a qualified arachnologist (spider specialist) to date. Interest in the hobo spider has been growing in California because it is rumored to cause necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds similar to the occasionally-dramatic bites from brown recluse spiders, another spider that does not occur in California. (For more information on the brown recluse, see Pest Notes: Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders.) Some members of the California medical community have read about the supposed effects of hobo spider venom and have diagnosed hobo spider bites without proof of the spider. The purpose of this Pest Note is to offer current information on the status of the hobo spider in California.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'The hobo spider is a member of the spider family Agelenidae, a common group that has many species throughout California and the rest of North America. Agelenid spiders can have very dense populations in certain habitats. The hobo spider shares traits with many of its relatives in the Agelenidae family, including coloration. It is a light brown spider with pale markings, about 1/2 to 5/8 inch in body length. However, unlike typical agelenids, hobo spiders build webs that are almost always hidden under objects and are not noticeably funnel-like. More typical members of this family construct a funnel web, which is a trampoline-like, horizontal web constricting back into a funnel or hole. The web is typically found in a crack between bricks, or under wood, stones, or vegetation. The spider waits in the mouth of the funnel for prey to fall onto the horizontal surface and then rushes out, grabs the prey, and takes it back to its funnel to consume. If you go outside on a dewy morning, you can often see many of these funnel webs. There are dozens of similar-looking spider species in California that build funnel webs, including members of the genera Agelenopsis (2 species), Calilena (13 species), Hololena (21 species), Novalena (4 species), and Rualena (8 species). There is even a wolf spider genus, Sosippus (1 species), in California that, unlike its free-hunting relatives, builds a funnel web. Therefore, if you see such a web in California, you should suspect many other spiders before considering the hobo spider as a possibility. None of these species causes necrotic wounds or serious injury to humans. To distinguish funnel-weaving spider species, the arachnids reproductive structures must be examined, a task that requires the skills of a qualified arachnologist. Each spider species has a distinctive design of the male and female reproductive organs that allows for species identification in most cases. (See the pictorial guide by Vetter and Antonelli, listed under References). These physical features of the males and females generally are unique for each species and are used by arachnologists for species differentiation. Until someone has examined reproductive features on dozens of hobo spiders and related species, it is unlikely that a hobo spider would be correctly identified with the naked eye. Therefore, virtually any supposed hobo spider identification by a non-arachnologist in California should be suspect. If you have access to a magnifying device (hand lens, microscope, etc.), there is an easy way to determine that a spider you have IS NOT a hobo spider. All funnel-weaving spiders have eight eyes arranged in two rows. If you look at the spider head, however, most of the agelenid spiders in California have their two rows of eyes curved so strongly that it appears that they are actually in three horizontal rows with four eyes in the middle row and two eyes above and below this row. This is known as the 2-4-2 eye pattern. Exceptions are the spiders of the genera Tegenaria and Eratigena, which have eyes that are in the more common pattern of two rows of four. This is also the most common eye pattern for spiders in general; and unless you remove the spider from a funnel web, it will probably not be a funnel-weaving spider. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon to find a funnel-weaving spider with two straight rows of eyes in California. There are two species of Tegenaria in the state, T. pagana and T. domestica. Their coloration is similar enough to that of the hobo spider, E. agrestis, that anyone except an arachnologist might easily confuse them with the hobo spider. Tegenaria pagana is found in coastal California regions and slightly inland. Tegenaria domestica, however, is an extremely common spider, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in body length, may be found throughout California and often inside homes, as is evident by the name domestica. In fact, T. domestica is found throughout the world, having been carried by commerce. Neither of these spiders is considered toxic to humans even though they are closely related to the hobo spider. MEDICAL ASPECTS Hobo spiders have been erroneously reported to have a bite that can leave a necrotic wound that gradually enlarges over several dayssimilar to that which is occasionally caused in some circumstances by a brown recluse spider. A reported characteristic symptom of hobo spider bites is a headache that persists for 2 to 7 days and does not abate with pain relievers. In its native European habitat, hobo spider venom is not considered toxic to humans. A study published in 2001 compared hobo spider venom from Pacific Northwest and European populations. The venom from these two sources was injected into the same strain of rabbits used in the initial research that implicated hobo spiders as potentially toxic to humans. Neither venom in the study produced necrotic wounds in the rabbits. An editorial published in 2004 examined the medical literature on hobo spider bites and found that there is only one case of a verified bite by a hobo spider that resulted in a necrotic skin lesion; this was in a person who had a pre-existing medical condition that also leads to necrotic skin lesions. A related study in Oregon, published in 2014, reported only one verified hobo spider bite: the victim was bitten in the calf and the only symptoms exhibited were pain, some redness and twitching in the leg for 12 hours before dissipating. These studies demonstrate that definitive proof is still lacking as to whether or not the hobo spider is a dangerous spider. Until proof is provided, however, it would be prudent to consider the hobo spider to be of minor medical importance. Also, on occasion, people have read about the Sydney funnel web spider from Australia which is highly toxic to humans. Because of similarity in the names, American funnel weaving spiders have erroneously been assumed to share this high toxicity. The Australian spiders are more closely related to tarantulas, not to the virtually harmless American funnel weavers. If you do get a necrotic wound in California, you and your medical professional should consider many other common causes to be more probable than a bite from a hobo or brown recluse spider. If an arthropod is involved at all, one should first consider all those creatures that seek out mammals for blood meals and may cause necrotic-type wounds. For more information, see the individual Pest Notes on Fleas, Bed Bugs, Conenose Bugs, and Lyme Disease in California . In addition there is a long list of medical conditions and diseases that exhibit necrotic-type wounds, such as bacterial infections (see Swanson and Vetter 2005). Any and all of these situations are more likely than the bite of a hobo spider in California.',\n",
       "       'damage': '',\n",
       "       'management': 'Because the hobo spider is not known to live in California, there is no need for control. However, reducing trash and rubble around the house and sealing windows and door jambs will help to reduce the number of spiders and other arthropods that can gain access into the home. In the garage (a well-known haven for spiders), use plastic bags tightly sealed to store items that are used only sporadically such as gardening apparel (gloves, old shirts, boots) and sports gear (baseball mitts, roller skates). This will help to minimize encounters with spiders but not eliminate them completely. Typically, pesticide applications targeting spiders are variable in efficacy unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it directly. Various insecticides are available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy, and much less toxic, to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. Sticky traps placed along floorboards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a nonchemical way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. A simple and effective way to minimize indoor spider populations is regular vacuuming, especially under furniture and in other nooks and crannies. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar to seal off the opening. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition, because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify.'},\n",

       "       'development': 'Spiders resemble insects and sometimes are confused with them, but they are arachnids, not insects. Spiders have eight legs and two body partsa head region (cephalothorax) and an abdomen. They lack wings and antennae. Although spiders often are found on plants, they eat mainly insects, other spiders, and related arthropods, not plants. Most spiders have toxic venom, which they use to kill their prey. However, only those spiders whose venom typically causes a serious reaction in humans are called poisonous spiders. See the sidebar: Spider Bites. Table 1. Common Spider Families in North America. Agelenidae, funnel weavers or grass spiders Sit-and-wait predators feed during the day and night on the ground in most types of vegetation, including low-growing plants and trees. Spin funnel-shaped webs, often with several-inch-wide, flat extension covering plants or soil. The spider waits in the hole of its web. When it detects vibrations from an insect that flew or walked into the web, the spider runs out, captures and bites the prey, then carries it back into the funnel to be eaten. Webs on low vegetation become conspicuous in morning light after collecting dew. Funnel weavers have six or eight eyes, all about the same size, arranged in two rows. About 300 species in North America. Araneidae, orb weavers or garden spiders Feed on insects that fly, fall, or are blown into web. Elaborate silken webs are spun in concentric circles. Spiderlings often make symmetrical webs; mature spiders may spin a more specialized design that is helpful in identifying certain species. The spider rests at the center of its web or hides in a shelter near the edge, waiting for prey to become entangled. Orb weavers generally have poor vision and rely on web vibrations to locate and identify prey. About 200 species in North America. Clubionidae (including Corinnidae), sac spiders or twoclawed hunting spiders Stalk and capture prey that is walking or resting on surfaces. They spin silken tubes or sacs under bark, among leaves, and in low plants or on the ground, where they hide during the day or retreat after hunting. Commonly are nocturnal, medium-sized, pale spiders with few markings. About 200 species in North America. Linyphiidae (=Microphantidae), dwarf spiders Prey on insects that fall, walk, or land in their web. Diurnal (day active) spiders occurring in the plant canopy and among litter on the ground. They produce sheetlike webs on the surface of plants or soil and are common in some field and vegetable crops. Most are relatively small. Several hundred species in North America. Lycosidae, wolf spiders Prey on insects that are walking or resting on the ground. Actively hunt in the open during the day and night, often observed on the ground in litter and on low vegetation. Can occur in burrows and under debris on soil. Instead of spinning webs to catch prey, make a small, thick web where they rest. Have a distinctive pattern of eyes: four small eyes in front in a straight row, one middle pair of larger eyes, and one rear pair of widely spaced eyes on top of the head. They have long hairy legs. They are usually black and white or strongly contrasting light and dark, which can make them difficult to discern unless they are moving. About 200 species in North America. Oxyopidae, lynx spiders Stalk and capture resting or walking insects. Active hunters with good vision. Most have spiny legs and a brightly colored body that tapers sharply toward the rear. They have four pairs of eyes grouped in a hexagon. About 2 dozen known species in North America. Salticidae, jumping spiders Day-active hunters in plants or on the ground. They make no web; instead they stalk and pounce on prey by jumping distances many times their body length. Jumping spiders have a distinctive pattern of eyes in three rows: the first row of four eyes, with large and distinctive middle eyes; a second row of two very small to minute eyes; and a third row of two medium sized eyes. They usually have an iridescent, metallic-colored abdomen and black carapace. About 300 species in North America. Theridiidae, cobweb, cobweb weaver, or combfooted spiders Feed on insects that walk or fly into their webs. Almost always found hanging upside down by their claws in irregularly spun, sticky webs, waiting for prey. The spider is usually concealed in a corner of the web, in a silken tent, or behind debris. This group includes the black widow spider, which produces relatively thick silk that feels rough and sticky. They generally have a soft, round, bulbous abdomen and slender legs without spines. Over 200 species in North America. Thomisidae, crab spiders or flower spiders Stalk and capture insects walking or resting on surfaces. Diurnal hunters that do not spin webs. Front two pairs of legs are enlarged and extend beyond the side of their flattened body, making them look like tiny crabs. Their small eyes occur in two slightly curved rows, with the top row often much wider than the lower row. Over 200 species in North America. Black Widow Spider The black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most common harmful spider in California. Venom from its bite can cause reactions ranging from mild to painful and serious, but death is very unlikely and many symptoms can be alleviated if medical treatment is obtained. Anyone bitten by this spider should remain calm and promptly seek medical advice; it is helpful if the offending spider can be caught and saved for identification. The typical adult female black widow has a shiny black body, slender black legs, and a red or orange mark in the shape of an hourglass on the underside of the large, round abdomen. The body, excluding legs, is 5/16 to 5/8 inch long. Only the larger immature female and adult female spiders are able to bite through a persons skin and inject enough venom to cause a painful reaction. The adult male black widow is one-half to two-thirds the length of the female, has a small abdomen, and is seldom noticed. The male black widow does possess venom, but its fangs are too small to break human skin. The top side of its abdomen is olive-greenish gray with a pattern of cream-colored areas and one light-colored band going lengthwise down the middle. The hourglass mark on the underside of the abdomen typically is yellow or yellow-orange and broad waisted. The legs are banded with alternating light and dark areas. Contrary to popular belief, the female black widow rarely eats the male after mating but may do so if hungry. Like males, young female black widow spiders are patterned on the top side. In the early stages they greatly resemble males but gradually acquire the typical female coloration with each shedding of the skin. In intermediate stages they have tan or cream-colored, olive-gray, and orange markings on the top side of the abdomen, a yellowish orange hourglass mark on the underside, and banded legs. Webs and Egg Sacs The web of the black widow is an irregular, tough-stranded, sticky cobweb mesh in which the spider hangs with its underside up. During the day it often hides under an object at the edge of the web or stays in a silken retreat in the center. The black widow may rush out of its hiding place when the web is disturbed, especially if egg sacs are present. The egg sacs are mostly spherical, about 1/2 inch long and 5/8 inch in diameter, creamy yellow to light tan in color, opaque, and tough and paperlike on the surface. A female may produce several egg sacs. Tiny, young black widows, which are nearly white in color, disperse to new locations by ballooning and infest new areas. Spider Bites Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-222-1222). Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, apply an antiseptic to prevent infection, and use ice or ice water to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary, try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist. Where the Spiders Live. Black widow spiders occur in most parts of California. They and their associated webs usually are found in dark, dry, sheltered, relatively undisturbed places such as among piles of wood, rubbish, or stones; in culverts, hollow stumps, and old animal burrows; in garages, sheds, barns, crawl spaces, utility meter boxes, and outhouses; and sometimes among plants. People are most likely to be bitten when they disturb the spider while they are cleaning out or picking up items in such places. A sensible precaution is to always wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt when working in areas that have been undisturbed for a time and where there are good hiding places for spiders. Effects of the Bite. The symptoms of a black widow bite are largely internal; little more than local redness and swelling may develop at the bite site. The internal effects may range from mild to severe. Pain tends to spread from the bite to other parts of the body and muscular spasms may develop. In severe cases the abdominal muscles may become quite rigid. Other effects can include profuse sweating, fever, increased blood pressure, difficulty breathing and speaking, restlessness, and nausea. Typically, the pain and other symptoms reach a maximum within a day of the bite, then gradually subside over the next 2 to 3 days. Most people who are bitten spend a few hours under observation by a physician but do not develop symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Small children, the elderly, and persons with health problems are likely to suffer some of the more severe consequences of the bite. Black widow bites are fairly common in California. Yellow Sac Spider The common, house-dwelling agrarian sac or yellow sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum, is a small spider that spins a silken sac web in the corners of ceilings and walls, and behind shelves and pictures; it is also commonly found outdoors in shrubbery. This spider is light yellow and has a slightly darker stripe on the upper middle of the abdomen. The eight eyes of this spider are all about equal in size and arranged in two horizontal rows. Yellow sac spiders can be seen running on walls and ceilings at night and quickly drop to the floor to escape if they are disturbed. Bites usually occur when the spider becomes trapped against a persons skin in clothing or bedding. It is estimated that sac spiders are responsible for more bites on people than any other spider. Typical symptoms of a bite include initial pain, redness, and sometimes swelling. Recluse Spiders Recluse spiders of the genus Loxosceles include the well-known brown recluse spider, L. reclusa, which does not occur in California. While the brown recluse has occasionally been brought into California in household furnishings, firewood, and motor vehicles, it does not reside in the state. However, populations of another recluse spider, the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta), were found in Los Angeles County in the late 1960s. In its native Chile it is known to have a bite that is toxic to humans. The native recluse spider of California (L. deserta) is found in the desert regions of southern California and neighboring states. Its bite can cause problems, but it is not as toxic as that of the Chilean recluse. In any case, bites from the desert recluse are rare and no bites from the Chilean recluse have ever been recorded in California despite its presence in heavily populated urban areas. Both the native desert recluse spider and the Chilean recluse spider occur principally in the drier areas of southern California. Recluse spiders can have a violin-shaped mark (with the neck of the violin pointing backward) on the top side of the head region (cephalothorax). However, the mark is not always distinct, so it should not be used as an identifying character. A unique feature of recluse spiders is their six eyes, arranged in pairs in a semicircle, which can be seen with the use of a good hand lens. Most other spiders have eight eyes. All recluse spiders make large, irregular, flattened, cobweb-type webs with thick strands extending in all directions. These spiders avoid light, are active at night, and tend to build their webs in out-of-the-way places. Chilean recluse spiders may be found indoors in boxes, in corners, behind pictures, in old clothing hanging undisturbed, and in other similar places. Desert recluse spiders appear outdoors where they may be found under rocks or wood. More detailed information on these spiders is available in Pest Notes: Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders . Other Spiders In addition to the species mentioned above, there are only a few other species of spiders in California that may on occasion bite humans. (Remember, if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician). One kind of red and black jumping spider, Phidippus johnsoni, may bite if it is disturbed, but the bites are usually not serious. The female spiders are black with red on the top side of the abdomen whereas the males are all red. These spiders range in size from 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Tarantulas are long-lived spiders that occupy burrows in the ground during the day but often come out at night to hunt insects near the burrow. They commonly are feared because of their large size and hairy appearance. Some poisonous tarantulas occur in tropical parts of the world, but the bites of California tarantulas are not likely to be seriousat worst, they are similar to a bee sting. However, because of the variety of tarantulas sold in the pet trade industry, there is a spectrum of venom potencies among these creatures. These spiders ranges from 1 to 2 inches in body size. The hobo spider, Tegenaria agrestis, also called the aggressive house spider, is a common spider in the Pacific Northwest. It builds funnel-shaped webs in dark, moist areas such as basements, window wells, wood piles, and around the perimeter of homes. It is a large (1 to 13/4 inch, including legs), fast-running brown spider with a herringbone or multiple chevron pattern on the top of the abdomen. The hobo spider has not been documented in California, but it has expanded its range from the Pacific Northwest to northern Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Although it has been stated as being a poisonous spider, recent research is challenging the original data that elevated this spider to medical importance. See Pest Notes: Hobo Spiders . One spider frequently found indoors is the common house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, which makes a cobweb in corners of rooms, in windows, and in similar places. Another is the marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, which was introduced into the state in the 1970s and has since displaced the once common longbodied cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides, a long-legged spider that resembles a daddy-longlegs. These spiders are only marginally capable of biting humans because their fangs are too short to pierce peoples skin; they primarily cause problems by producing messy cobwebs. Various kinds of small hunting spiders may wander indoors and occasionally, rather large, hunting-type spiders are discovered in homes or garages. Often these are fully grown wolf spider or tarantula males that have reached maturity and are searching for females. When these spiders are wandering, one or more may accidentally get indoors. New houses and other structures in developments may be invaded by wolf spiders that have lost their usual outdoor living places. The more insects that exist inside a building, the more likely it is to have spiders living there. Usually spiders are most abundant in fall following the first few rains of the season. Immature and adult female burrow-living spiders sometimes wander for a time during the rainy season if they have had to abandon wet burrows.',\n",

       "       'management': 'Spiders may enter houses and other structures through cracks and other openings. They also may be carried in on items like plants, firewood, and boxes. To prevent spiders from coming indoors, seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors. Good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they prey upon. Regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, basements, and other seldom used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive the tumbling process through the hose. Indoors, a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider because occupied spider webs are maintained for cleanliness to enhance prey capture. Individual spiders can also be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. They can then be released outdoors. Watch this video to learn more: How to catch a spider. In indoor storage areas, place boxes off the floor and away from walls, whenever possible, to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders. Sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within. Clean up clutter in garages, sheds, basements, and other storage areas. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Outdoors, eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash, leaf litter, heavy vegetation, and other accumulations of materials. Trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attracts spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Chemical Control: Insecticides will not provide long-term control and should not generally be used against spiders outdoors. Typically, controlling spiders with pesticides is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control, including pyrethrins and pyrethroids (synthetic versions of pyrethrins) such as resmethrin, allethrin, or combinations of these products. Control by spraying is only temporary unless accompanied by housekeeping. It is just as easy and much less toxic to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe or to vacuum it up. Sticky traps offer a noninsecticidal way to remove spiders from your home as long as you can place the traps where pets and children cant tamper with them. Sorptive dusts containing amorphous silica gel (silica aerogel) and pyrethrins, which can be applied by professional pest control applicators only, may be useful in certain indoor situations. Sorptive dust particles affect the outer covering of spiders (and also insects) that have crawled over a treated surface, causing them to dry out and die. When applied as a dustlike film and left in place, a sorptive dust provides permanent protection against spiders. The dust is most safely and effectively used in cracks and crevices and in attics, wall voids, and other enclosed or unused places. SPIDER BITES: Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically, the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-876-4766 or 1-800-8-POISON). One must also keep in mind that although it is impossible to be certain, people and their physicians often blame spiders as the cause of skin lesions with no proof of spider involvement when there are many similar-appearing, non-spider maladies; therefore, care must be exerted in the diagnostic process. Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, and use ice, ice water or cold compresses to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Protect spiders in your garden because they prey on insects and other pests. Most spiders observed in the open during the day are not likely to bite you or cause lasting harm if they do bite you. Spiders whose bites might require you to seek medical attention spend most of their time hidden. Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have 8 legs and 2 body partsan abdomen and a combined head and thorax. They lack wings and antennae. Spider families vary by body shape, web type, hunting or other behavior, and the arrangement and relative size of their eyes. Cellar spiders have long, skinny legs and hang upside down in dark corners, often indoors, sometimes bouncing when disturbed. The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, is shown here. Cobweb spiders hang upside down in sticky, irregularly spun webs waiting for prey. Most cobweb species are small and harmless, such as this Theridion dilutum. Western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most well-known cobweb spider. Most black widow bites come from mature adult females (left), which can usually be recognized by a red hourglass on the underside of the abdomen. The adult male (right) is lighter-colored and smaller than the female. Crab or flower spiders, such as Misumena vatia, have enlarged front legs. They hunt during the day without webs. Dwarf spiders are tiny, hunt during the day, and produce sheetlike or irregular crisscross webs on surfaces. Funnel weavers spin thick, flattened webs and sit at the center of a silken hole, or funnel, running out to capture prey that contact the web. Often seen are Hololena nedra (left) and the common house spider, Tegenaria species, (right) found in gardens and on walls and ceilings inside the house. Lynx spiders are active hunters that stalk and capture prey. Legs are spiny, and the abdomen is narrowest at the rear. They dont spin webs. Shown here is a green lynx spider, Peucetia viridans . Jumping spiders hunt during the day, stalking and pouncing on prey. They are hairy, sometimes iridescent, and dont spin webs. This Phidippus species is eating a house fly. Orb weaver or garden spiders, such as this western spotted orb weaver, Neoscona oaxacensis, (left) often are large and colorful and wait in their webs or nearby for prey to become entangled. They spin elaborate webs in concentric circles in the garden. Sac spiders hide in silk tubes in places such as corners, beneath plants, or on bark, and stalk prey at night. They occur indoors and out and usually are pale, such as this agrarian sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum. Wolf spiders have long, hairy legs and are often found running along the ground. They dont build webs to capture prey but can have a silken retreat. Females carry young on their backs.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Contrary to popular belief, there are no populations of the brown recluse, Loxosceles reclusa, in California. In fact, fewer than 20 verified specimens have been collected in the state over several decades by spider experts. Yet people in California frequently relate stories in which they or someone they know was supposedly bitten or they have had a physician diagnose them with a brown recluse spider bite. Black widows on the other hand, are very common throughout the state, causing potentially serious injury with their bite. The adult females are easily identifiable by their shiny black body color and red hourglass on the belly. For information on black widows, see the Pest Notes: Widow Spiders and Their Relatives. Although the brown recluse does not live in California, four species of native recluse spiders occur in southern areas of the state and can cause similar medical concerns. The most common Californian recluse spider is the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta . It is found mostly in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, in the foothills of the lower San Joaquin Valley, and in adjacent areas of Mexico; most of these areas are sparsely populated by humans. This publication was written to provide science-based information about the status of the brown recluse and other related spiders in California. COMMON AND SCIENTIFIC NAMES Over the years, the group of spiders to which the brown recluse belongs has been known by various colloquial names: \"violin\" spiders, \"fiddleback\" spiders, \"recluse\" spiders, and \"brown\" spiders. The recluse spiders are in the family Sicariidae (formerly Loxoscelidae). The scientific name for the recluse spider genus is Loxosceles (lox-SOS-a-leez) and rhymes somewhat with \"isosceles\" as in the triangle. Whereas \"isosceles\" means equal legs, \"loxosceles\" means slanted legs, referring to the way the recluse spiders hold their legs at rest. All known members of the group have scientific names, and the more familiar members of this group also have common names (e.g., brown recluse, desert recluse, Arizona recluse).',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'The most definitive physical feature of recluse spiders is their eyes : most spiders have 8 eyes that typically are arranged in 2 rows of 4, but recluse spiders have 6 equal-sized eyes arranged in 3 pairs, each pair called dyads. There is a dyad at the front of the cephalothorax (the first main body part to which the legs attach) and another dyad on each side further back with a space separating the dyads from one another. Many publications refer to the \"violin\" marking on the dorsal (top) surface of the cephalothorax (head region) as the most important diagnostic feature. Although this marking is fairly consistent in mature brown recluses and Texan recluses (Loxosceles devia), it can vary in intensity, sometimes fading on preserved specimens, and it is very faint to nonexistent in several recluse species found in the southwestern United States (e.g., the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta). Therefore, checking the eye pattern is the best way to eliminate almost all suspect non-recluse spiders from consideration, whereas the presence or absence of the violin marking may lead to misidentifications. Non-arachnologists (including physicians, pest control operators, and even some entomologists) have envisioned \"violins\" on various body surfaces of harmless spiders and incorrectly assume that they have properly identified a brown recluse spider. In addition, the abdomens of all North American recluses are covered with fine hairs and are uniformly colored (not patterned), although the coloration can vary from light beige to dark brown, depending in part on what they have eaten recently. There is never a color pattern on the abdomen of North American specimens. Finally, the uniformly colored legs are similarly covered with fine hairs whereas many non-recluse spiders have stout spines and a pattern of stripes, rings, or spots on their legs. Some other spiders share one or more of these physical characteristics. However, to be identified as a recluse spider, it must have all 5 of these characteristics. six eyes in dyads (pairs) uniformly colored abdomen with fine hairs no spines on the legs uniformly colored legs body not more than 3/8\" in length On this basis, more than 99% of the spiders found by Californians can be identified as something other than a recluse spider. In the unlikely event that one does find a recluse spider in California, it will most likely be the native desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta. To identify Loxosceles spiders to species level requires a high-magnification microscope and the skills of a spider expert (arachnologist). SPIDERS COMMONLY CONFUSED WITH RECLUSES Because of the misinformation surrounding the brown recluse\\'s presence in California, many spiders that are virtually harmless are submitted by the public to arachnologists for identification. Most of them are not from the recluse family and some are not even spiders. A nationwide study was undertaken from 2000 to 2005, offering to identify any spider that was considered to be a brown recluse spider. Nearly 600 specimens were submitted from California, many from people who were adamant that they had a brown recluse. Only one of these specimens was a brown recluse, from a house where the family had moved from Missouri, a state that is well-known to have abundant brown recluse populations. No additional recluses were found in the house. The occasional finding of a translocated brown recluse spider is not surprising; however, it still is extremely rare. There were 17 desert recluse spiders submitted in this study, all from the desert regions of southeastern California where the spiders are known to occur. Non-recluse spiders were submitted in great numbers including many false black widows, woodlouse, and yellow sac spiders. Presented below are descriptions of spiders that share some of the same physical features as the brown recluse and have been misidentified as recluse spiders. For additional information on these spiders, consult a spider identification book such as Common Spiders of North America by Richard Bradley, listed in the References section or the table of common spider families found in California, located in the Pest Notes: Spiders . Six-Eyed Spiders Spitting spiders (Scytodes spp.) are closely related to recluse spiders and have 6 eyes arranged in a similar pattern. However, unlike recluse spiders, they also have many black spots or lines on their bodies and a strongly domed cephalothorax. The woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata, has 6 eyes arranged in 2 groups of 3 (triads) and no bodily markings. Spiders with Violin-Shaped or Other Dark Markings Many common tan or gray spiders have dark markings on the head region, which convinces people that they have caught a true recluse spider. These spiders include cellar spiders (Pholcus phalangioides, Psilochorus spp., Physocyclus spp.), pirate spiders (Mimetus spp.), and sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae family). The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, also confuses people even though the dark marks are on the ventral (underside) not the dorsal (top) surface of the body. The most common submissions as brown recluses are spiders in the genus Titiotus . These spiders are found just north of Los Angeles, through central California to Redding and are common in forests. Titiotus spiders have a hair pattern that gives the impression of a violin and its coloration is similar to that of a brown recluse. Another frequent submission is Zoropsis spinimana, which is found in the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento. It is a harmless Mediterranean immigrant species, first detected in California around 1995. It is large and frequently captured in homes. Residents see the dark marking on the top surface of the abdomen as a violin, but recluses have this type of marking on their cephalothorax. See the Pest Notes: Zoropsis spinimana, A Mediterranean Spider in California for more information. Ubiquitous Brown Spiders Virtually every spider that is tan or brown has been turned in by Californians as a potential brown recluse. There are hundreds of species of these spiders in California. They include ground spiders (Gnaphosidae), sac spiders (Cheiracanthium spp., Trachelas spp.), wolf spiders (Lycosidae), grass spiders (Agelenidae), orb weavers (Araneidae), and male crevice spiders (Filistatidae). Additionally, males of both the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the false black widow, Steatoda grossa, are frequently brought in as suspected recluse spiders. All of these brown spiders have 8 eyes and thus can be quickly eliminated from consideration. AMERICAN RECLUSE SPIDERS Eleven species of recluse spiders are native to the United States and two non-natives have become established in certain highly-limited areas of the country. The brown recluse spider is the proper common name for only one species, Loxosceles reclusa . It is the most widespread of the North American recluse spiders and lives in the south central Midwest from southeastern Nebraska to southwestern Ohio and south through Texas to north Georgia. In addition to these native species, the Chilean recluse spider, Loxosceles laeta (pronounced \"LEE-ta\"), has become established in portions of Los Angeles (Alhambra, Sierra Madre, Monterey Park, and San Gabriel). This spider, however, seems to be confined to a very limited area in Los Angeles County, has been present there for at least 80 years (one specimen was collected from Los Angeles in 1936) and is not spreading. Also, occasional interceptions of the Mediterranean recluse, Loxosceles rufescens are found in commercial goods shipped from out-of-state or from international cargo, but no populations of this spider are currently known in California and finds of them are still incredibly rare. Recluse spiders, as their name implies, are reclusive. They build webs as trigger systems to indicate that potential prey are walking nearby. They also use silk to build retreats in which to hide during the day. These nocturnal spiders emerge from their retreats at night and actively hunt down prey or may wait for prey to land in the small area several inches from their retreat. As dawn approaches, they may seek shelter in dark places such as in clothing or shoes, and mature males roam in search of females. It is these two behaviors that can bring them into contact with people. In nature, recluses are found in cracks and crevices in and under rocks or the loose bark of dead trees. Recluses have very much benefited from human-altered environments, where they are readily found under trash cans, plywood, tarps, rubber tires, and in storage boxes. They are synanthropic (found in association with humans) and therefore are considered \"house\" spiders. In fact in South America, the recluse species have common names that translate as \"the spider behind the picture\" or \"the spider in the corner.\" Recluse spiders are relatively long lived. Among the various species, they mature after about 1 year and average a 2- to 4-year life span with some living more than 7 years under laboratory conditions. They are also well known for surviving long periods (6 to 12 months) without food before perishing. Abundance of Recluses One consistent life history characteristic of recluse spiders is that in the right environment their populations are usually dense. If you find recluses, you do not find one, you find many. The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is a common house spider in the midwestern United States. Examples of the densities that the brown recluse can attain around human habitation include 9 under a piece of plywood in Oklahoma, 52 in an indoor laboratory, 6 under a waterbed frame in Arkansas, 40 collected in a Missouri barn in one hour, and 44 caught in sticky traps in a Tennessee home in one day. Eight Oklahoma 13-year-olds unknowingly hand-collected about 60 amongst bricks in about 7 minutes without getting bitten. In a 6-month study, a family in Kansas collected 2,055 brown recluse spiders in their 19th-century built home. They lived there nearly a decade, continued to find brown recluse spiders regularly, and only once in 10 years had anyone shown evidence of a bite; it was to a finger which turned red for a few days and then healed without incident. In fact, on many evenings, this family collected more brown recluse spiders per hour in their home than the entire California human population has ever been able to find in the state. Similarly, for the desert recluse in California, 12 of these spiders were collected under a doghouse in Yucca Valley and 6 were removed in one night from a small cottage bedroom in a Mojave Desert research facility. Absence of Brown Recluses in California Unlike many other spiders that disperse by either migrating or being carried by air currents when small (\"ballooning\"), recluse spiders usually only expand outside their native range as a result of human intervention. The few brown recluses that have been collected in California typically are found in facilities that receive goods from out of state or are unintentionally transported by people who have moved from the Midwest. In these instances, searching the immediate area yielded no additional brown recluses so they were considered to be individual stowaways. Undoubtedly, more brown recluses have been inadvertently brought into the state via commerce and the relocation of household belongings, especially during the Dust Bowl era, however amazingly few specimens have ever been collected. Translocated recluse spiders have never been able to establish a foothold and start a population in California. Considering that brown recluse spider bites are not common in the south-central Midwest where brown recluses frequently cohabit with people, it is clear that California does not have anywhere near sufficient populations of these spiders to be responsible for the number of bites that are attributed to them. RICE Therapy: The recommended treatment for most brown recluse bites (the ones that do not develop severe symptoms) is simple first aid: RICE therapy. R est I ce C ompression E levation',\n",
       "       'damage': 'All Loxosceles spiders tested so far have the venom component that is capable of causing necrotic skin lesions, so it is best to assume that all recluse spiders may be capable of causing skin damage. In general, the desert recluse spider\\'s venom is similar to that of the brown recluse and should be considered of equal potency. In comparison to the brown recluse spider, the Chilean recluse supposedly has more potent venom and the Mediterranean recluse\\'s venom has been said to be less potent. However, these comparisons are more anecdotal than quantitive assessments. About 10% of brown recluse bites cause moderate or greater tissue damage and scarring, but the vast majority only result in inflammation and heal well without medical intervention. Deaths have been reported in children, however these are extremely rare occurrences and can be prevented if accurately diagnosed and the proper medical treatment applied. Medical Misdiagnoses The problem of misdiagnosis is widespread in North America, including such unlikely places as Alaska and Canada where doctors have attributed skin lesions to recluse bites when no brown recluse spiders have ever been found north of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. One reason for the great awareness of the recluse spiders throughout North America is that necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds are commonly misdiagnosed as \"brown recluse bites.\" Although recluses can cause these types of wounds, the biological data involving the distribution of the spider indicate that most of these diagnoses are incorrect. A world-renowned toxicology physician who worked at University of Southern California Medical Center estimates that most general spider bites in California referred to him were actually the work of other arthropods, and that 60% of \"brown recluse spider bite\" diagnoses came from areas where no Loxosceles spiders were known to exist. This is a serious problem, in that several medical conditions misdiagnosed as recluse bites can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal consequences. Additionally, many people diagnosed as having brown recluse bites in California are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics work against bacteria and have no effect on spider venom. However, regardless of the causative agent, it is wise to seek medical attention if you feel that it is warranted. Because most brown recluse bites involve only inflammation, the recommended treatment is simple first aid: RICE therapy (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) although other medical experts suggest cold instead of ice (to avoid freezing tissue) and a neutral position (lay flat) rather than elevated. Multiple Lesions Spiders typically bite only once as a desperate defensive effort before they are crushed between flesh and some object. Therefore, spider bites are not the causes of skin lesions if 1) there are multiple lesions on one person at the same time, especially if the lesions are on widely separated parts of the body, 2) if there are multiple episodes of lesions on the same person over a period of several weeks or months, or 3) if there are multiple people in the same house or facility showing skin lesions at the same time. Multiple lesions immediately point toward the more likely situation of a contagious bacterial infection like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or possibly an infestation of an arthropod (fleas, mites, kissing bugs, bed bugs, etc.) that seeks out mammals for blood meals. Bacterial Infections Group A Streptococcus infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis, is sometimes misdiagnosed as a brown recluse bite, and has a fatality rate that can vary from 20 to 80% depending on how quickly it is correctly diagnosed. In serious cases, death from Strepococcus A can occur in a few days. Another medical condition that is frequently misdiagnosed as a spider bite or brown recluse bite is MRSA bacterial infection. Infections of this pathogen, which began to emerge in the 1990s, are no worse than other Staph infections. However, because they are not remedied by common antibiotics, the infections continue out of control and can be fatal unless properly medicated. In one national study involving 11 university-based medical facilities, 29% of the patients presenting for \"spider bite\" had MRSA as the cause of their skin and soft tissue injury. MRSA is a contagious infection, frequently found in places where people are housed in close quarters for lengthy periods of time. Such conditions include prisons and other correctional facilities, nursing homes, long-term health care facilities, sports camps, military barracks, and locker rooms and typically involve several people being afflicted simultaneously. Very often \"spider bites\" are the first thing that people blame as the cause of these wounds. However, more careful investigation typically leads to identifying a MRSA bacterial infection as the causal agent.The problem clears up quickly when the bacterial infection is correctly diagnosed and treated. Necrotic Wound Causes If you do get a necrotic wound in California, you and your medical professional should consider many other common causes to be much more probable than a bite from a brown recluse spider. If an arthropod is involved at all, one should first consider all those creatures that seek out mammals for blood meals and may cause necrotic-type wounds. These include mites, fleas, bed bugs, mosquitoes, soft ticks, hard ticks, and blood-sucking conenose bugs (also known as kissing bugs) (see Pest Notes : Fleas, Bed Bugs, Mosquitoes, Conenose Bugs, and Lyme Disease in California listed in SUGGESTED READING). In addition, there is a long list of medical conditions and diseases that exhibit necrotic-type wounds. A few of these are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial infections, lymphomatoid papulosis (a non-Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphoma), diabetic ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, infected herpes simplex, herpes zoster (\"shingles\"), chemical and thermal burns, poison ivy, poison oak, and Lyme disease. Any and all of these situations are more likely than the bite of a brown recluse spider in California.',\n",
       "       'management': 'If you do not live in the shaded areas on the map, you do not need to be concerned with recluse spiders in California. If you do live within the range of these spiders, you still need to verify that you have recluses on your property before attempting control. Not all micro-habitats within the shaded areas will be suitable for recluse survival. For example, even though Loxosceles laeta occurs in densely populated sections of Los Angeles, this species is usually found only in dark commercial and municipal storage basements, not in homes. This leaves the desert recluse as the only California species of concern, and a minor one at that. After verifying that you do have desert recluses in your home, there are steps you can take to reduce encounters with them. These measures are similar for reducing encounters with spiders in general. Nonchemical control The most important precaution is to remove or reduce outdoor trash and rubbish, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cansespecially if they are stored right next to the house. In residences with attached garages, block off house access to spiders by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites in self defense. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any bed skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under the bed. This minimizes the chance that any spider can crawl onto the bed and inflict a bite. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally used (gardening clothes and gloves, boots, baseball mitts, seasonal clothes and gear, etc.) should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags or bins, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Sticky traps placed along floor boards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. See the short UC IPM YouTube video How to Catch a Spider. Chemical control Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy and much less toxic for your living area to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify. Freeze the spider first, soak it in rubbing alcohol for a few days to preserve it, then pour off the alcohol and rinse the spider with water to remove alcohol residue before shipping. When sending the spider in for identification, do not mail it in alcohol as this is a violation of postal regulations.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Spiders are mostly beneficial because they feed on pest insects. However, many people think that all spiders are dangerous and aggressive. In California, the main spider capable of causing serious injury is the black widow, which generally remains outdoors and out of sight. Spiders seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people. Focus pest management efforts on removing webs and hiding places. Pesticides are not generally recommended. What to know about spiders: The jaws of most spiders are too small to bite humans. Adult female black widows are the main spiders capable of seriously injuring people in California. They are shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the underside and are commonly found outdoors, in sheltered, dry, undisturbed areas such as wood piles and garages. Anyone bitten by a black widow spider should remain calm and seek medical advice. The brown recluse spider and the hobo spider do not live in California. Some other spiders bite when trapped in clothing or bedding, but the effect is usually no more severe than itching or the reaction to a bee sting. To prevent spiders from entering your house, take these steps: Seal home foundation cracks and other access holes. Inspect window and door screens for good seals to keep out spiders and the insects they prey on. Keep areas around home foundations free of clutter. Manage spiders using these tips: Indoors, regular housecleaning provides adequate spider control. Vacuum up the spider and its web. Alternatively, squash spiders or capture them in a jar and release them outside. Prevent clutter buildup that can provide spider hiding places both indoors and out. Remove spider webs from the exterior of the house with a broom or high pressure hose. Spiders and biological control: When removing spiders, dont overlook the fact that spiders eat a large number and variety of nuisance and pest insects. Spiders also have natural enemieswasps, other spiders, birds, reptiles, and othersthat sometimes keep them from becoming too numerous.',\n",

For some gardeners, this intensive management may include the application of pesticides to manage insects and mites.

       "       'development': \"Aphids. Aphids are the most common insect pests on roses. Species include the rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae, the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, and the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, among others. Aphids favor rapidly growing tissue such as buds and shoots. Low to moderate levels of aphids do little damage to plants, although some gardeners may be concerned by their very presence. Moderate to high populations can secrete copious amounts of honeydew, resulting in the growth of sooty mold, which blackens leaves. Very high numbers of aphids may distort or kill buds or reduce flower size. In most areas of California aphids are only considered a major problem for about 6 weeks in spring and early summer before high summer temperatures reduce their numbers. Aphids have many natural enemies including parasitic wasps, lady beetles, soldier beetles, and syrphid flies (see the section on Common Natural Enemies) that may rapidly reduce increasing populations. Ants protect aphids from natural enemies, so keeping them out of bushes with sticky barriers, baits, or traps may improve biological control. Lady beetles often increase in number when aphid populations are high. The convergent lady beetle is sold at nurseries for release against aphids and may provide limited control when properly released. For more information on how to release them see UC IPMs convergent lady beetle page in the Natural Enemies Gallery. Releasing green lacewings against the rose aphid has not been shown to offer significant control in research trials. A naturally occurring fungal disease may control aphids when conditions are wet or humid. In many landscape situations, knocking aphids off with a forceful stream or spray of water early in the day is all that is needed to supplement natural control. Insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils (including neem oil) can also be used to suppress aphids with only moderate impact on natural enemies. Soil-applied systemic insecticides, such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, are effective but are not usually necessary and may harm pollinators and natural enemies. Use of broadly toxic insecticides is not warranted in most gardens and landscapes. For more information on aphids see Pest Notes: Aphids . Insects and Mites that Cause Leaves to Stipple or Yellow Spider mites, including twospotted spider mite, Pacific spider mite, and strawberry spider mite, all in the genus Tetranychus, feed on foliage, causing leaves to become stippled or bleached, and may cause leaves to dry up and fall. Some species produce webbing while others do not. Spider mites are tiny (about the size of the period at the end of this sentence) and are best seen with a magnifier. Mites usually appear first on the undersides of leaves but may move to the upper surfaces as populations increase. High numbers are usually associated with dry, dusty conditions. Spider mite numbers may greatly increase if their many natural enemies are killed by broad-spectrum insecticides applied against other pests. For instance, applications of carbaryl or pyrethroid insecticides (such as cyfluthrin and permethrin) to control insect pests are frequently followed by an increase in mite populations. Conserving natural enemies, providing sufficient irrigation, and reducing dust may all help control mites. Overhead irrigation or periodic washing of leaves with water can be very effective in reducing mite numbers. If chemical treatment is necessary, spider mites can be controlled with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, and sprays should be targeted to ensure coverage of the undersides of the leaves. Although spider mites may be listed on many insecticide labels, most insecticides are not very effective against them and can actually trigger mite flare-ups as mentioned above. For more information about spider mites, see Pest Notes: Spider Mites . Rose leafhopper, Edwardsiana rosae, causes stippling damage that appears larger than mite stippling. Along with stippling, cast skins and the absence of webbing on the underside of leaves are good indications that leafhoppers are present. Leafhoppers are not common problems in most areas; be sure to check for the insects themselves if suspect stippling is observed. Plants can tolerate moderate stippling. Knock leafhoppers off with a water spray or use an insecticidal soap on nymphs if an infestation is severe. Insects that Distort or Discolor Blossoms Thrips. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, and madrone thrips, Thrips madroni, primarily cause injury to rose flowers, causing blossom petals to streak with brown or become distorted. Damage may be severe if flowers are attacked early at the bud stage. The tiny yellow or black thrips insects can be found within the blossoms. In August 2015, a new species of thrips, the chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis, was found infesting roses in southern California. This species, which is native to Asia and about the size of western flower thrips, can severely distort plant growth. This species may be found on leaves, leaf litter, on the axils of leaves, in curled leaves, and under the calyxes of flowers. Chilli thrips has a broad host range and, because of its habit of attacking leaves as well as flowers, has the potential to cause much more serious damage than other thrips species. Thrips problems are more likely to be severe where many rose plants grown close together provide a continuously blooming habitat. Fragrant, light-colored, and white roses are most often attacked and can be severely damaged. Cultivars with sepals that remain tightly wrapped around the bud until blooms open have fewer thrips problems. In most home garden and landscape situations, thrips can be tolerated. Frequent clipping and prompt disposal of spent blooms may reduce thrips problems. Control with insecticides is difficult because products are most effective on developing thrips, which usually feed deep within buds or flowers where pesticide applications cannot reach. It should be noted that western flower thrips can sometimes be considered beneficial because they are predators of spider mites. Insects that Chew Blossoms and/or Leaves Fuller rose beetle. Adults of Fuller rose beetle, Naupactus godmani, chew flowers and foliage leaving notched or ragged edges. Adult beetles are pale brown weevils that are about 3/8 inch long. They are flightless and hide during the day, often on the undersides of leaves. Feeding takes place at night. The larvae are root feeders but do not seriously damage roses. Low numbers can be ignored. Otherwise, handpick the beetles off plants, use sticky material on stems to trap and exclude them, and trim any branches touching walls, fences, or other plants. In California, adults emerge from June to November and are difficult to control with insecticides. Parasitic nematodes, which attack larvae, may be helpful if applied to the soil in early to midsummer. Hoplia beetle, Hoplia callipyge, is about 1/4 inch long and chews holes mostly in the petals of open flowers. It is primarily a problem in the Central Valley from Sacramento south to Bakersfield. The hoplia beetle prefers feeding on flowers of light-colored roses (white, pink, apricot, and yellow) and does not damage leaves. Larvae are root feeders but do not feed on the roots of rose plants. There is only one generation a year and damage is usually confined to the 2- to 4-week period in late spring when adults are active. Adult hoplia beetles can be handpicked or infested rose blooms removed. Insecticide sprays are not very effective and should not be necessary in a garden situation. For more information about hoplia beetle, see Pest Notes: Hoplia Beetle . Hoplia beetles may be mistaken for Japanese beetles, Popillia japonica, serious pests in other areas of the United States, but Japanese beetles are about twice as long and are metallic green with coppery wing covers. Japanese beetles are not established in California. If you believe you have found a Japanese beetle in your landscape, contact the California Department of Food and Agriculture Hotline (1-800-491-1899; also see cdfa.ca.gov/plant/JB/). Leafcutting bees, Megachile spp., cut semicircular holes in the margins of leaves and carry leaf material back to use in lining their nests. Bees are important pollinators and should not be killed. There are no effective controls. Rose curculio, Merhynchites bicolor ., is a reddish-black snout weevil about 1/4 inch long that prefers yellow and white roses. Adults feed by drilling holes in flower buds that may kill the developing bud or result in ragged holes in blossoms when they open. If weevils are numerous, terminal shoots may be killed as well. Eggs are laid inside buds and larvae feed within, often killing buds before they open. When mature, larvae drop to the ground to overwinter and pupate in the soil, emerging as adults in spring. There is only one generation a year. Hand pick adults off plants and destroy buds infested with larvae. Many beetles may be removed from heavily infested bushes by gently shaking plants over a bucket of soapy water. A broad-spectrum insecticide can be applied to kill adults if the infestation is severe. Caterpillars such as orange tortrix, tussock moth, fruittree leafroller, tent caterpillar, and omnivorous looper may feed on rose leaves, flowers and buds . Some of these caterpillars may also tie leaves together with silk. Some caterpillars, like the tobacco budworm, may bore into flower buds. Look for the caterpillar or its frass inside. Hand pick caterpillars or prune out and promptly dispose of infested buds or rolled leaves (often hiding caterpillars within). Damage is usually not severe and treatment with pesticides not generally necessary. Leaf-feeding caterpillars can be reduced with the microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis or the insecticide spinosad. These materials will be most effective when caterpillars are small, and caterpillars within buds are unlikely to be killed. Damage may not be noticed until after caterpillars are full grown and no longer vulnerable to insecticide applications. Roseslugs include several species of sawflies that damage leaves on roses. Sawflies are wasps with plant-feeding larvae that resemble caterpillars. Young larvae skeletonize lower leaf surfaces while mature larvae chew large holes in leaves. Roseslugs have many natural enemies that help keep their populations down. They may be washed off plants with strong streams of water or killed with insecticidal soap, horticultural oil, or spinosad. Insecticides containing Bacillus thuringiensis are not effective against roseslugs because they are not the larvae of butterflies or moths. Insects that Cause Canes to Die Back Flatheaded borers, Chrysobothris spp., may kill canes or entire plants. Larvae are white and up to 1 inch long with enlarged heads. Adult beetles do not significantly damage roses. Eggs tend to be laid on stressed rose plants, especially in bark wounds caused by sunburn or disease. Remove and destroy infested plant material and keep plants healthy by providing sufficient irrigation and avoiding excessive summer pruning. Raspberry horntail larvae, Hartigia cressoni, are white, segmented larvae up to 1 inch long that feed within rose stems or canes. Adults are black or black and yellow wood wasps about 1/2 inch long. In the spring, horntail feeding can cause tips of canes to wilt and die, reducing second-cycle rose blooms. Inspect canes in spring (mid-April to mid-June) for egg-laying incisions or swellings caused by larvae feeding within and cut them off below the infestation. Prune down infested canes until a healthy cross section is found. Scale insects that may attack roses include two species of armored scales: the rose scale, Aulacaspis rosae, and the San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus . These pests may cause cane decline or dieback when numbers are high. San Jose scale may spread by wind from nearby orchards, and so may be found on roses near urban-agricultural interfaces in California's Central Valley and other fruit or nut tree production areas. Armored scales can be observed on canes as small, grayish, round to oval encrustations, ranging in size from 1/8 to 1/4 inch. These insects have no legs or antennae for most of their lives and are immobile. In winter, cut back and destroy infested canes and apply insecticidal oil to any remaining infested canes if the scale population is high. Scales are attacked by many natural enemies. Look for exit holes in mature scale covers, indicating parasitization. Other scale insects, including cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi, and several species of soft scales such as black scale, Saissetia oleae, may also be found on roses. These insects produce honeydew, which may cause leaves to be sticky and will allow black sooty mold to colonize leaf surfaces. Washing plants with soap and water may reduce populations. Pruning and application of horticultural oil in winter for armored scales should provide sufficient control. For more information about scale insects, see Pest Notes: Scales . Insects Seldom Found in California Roses Mossy rose galls, created by the gall wasp Diplolepis rosae, are spherical spined masses of plant tissue about an inch in diameter that form on year-old rose twigs. At first, the deformity resembles moss, but it becomes hardened as it enlarges. Although mossy rose gall is most common, many kinds of galls can form on roses; most caused by different gall wasp species. They may occur on twigs, stems or leaves and have various shapes and textures. Galls are more common in cooler, northern parts of California than in the Central Valley. They are generally not damaging and pruning them out should provide sufficient control. Rose midge, Dasineura rhodophaga, was found infesting roses in a nursery in Petaluma, California, in August 1996; however, it has not been reported in California since. This pest can cause severe damage and is established in Oregon, Washington, and other states, so rose growers should be on the lookout for new infestations, especially when purchasing new plants. Rose midges are tiny flies that lay their eggs inside the sepals of flower buds or on plant terminals. Hatching larvae move into flower buds to feed, leaving the injured buds to wither, blacken, and die. Pupation occurs in the soil and 2 to 4 generations can occur annually. Take any suspected infested material to your county Agricultural Commissioner for identification. Don't confuse the rose midge with the similar looking beneficial midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza, which feeds on aphids. Aphidoletes larvae are found on stem, bud, or leaf surfaces feeding within aphid colonies, whereas Dasineura larvae will be hidden out of view at the bases of developing buds. COMMON NATURAL ENEMIES Aphid parasites. Tiny parasitic wasps are very important in the control of aphids on roses. Adults lay their eggs within the aphid and developing wasp larvae feeding within rapidly immobilize the aphids. Eventually, the parasites kill the aphids and turn them into bronze or black crusty, bloated mummies. The parasitic wasp larva pupates within the mummy and then cuts a neat, round hole and emerges as a full-grown wasp . Once you see one mummy in the aphid colony, you are likely to see more. Parasitic wasps are also important in the control of scale insects, caterpillars, and many other insect pests. Minute pirate bug. Minute pirate bugs, Orius tristicolor, are tiny true bugs with black and white markings as adults. They are often among the first predators to appear in spring, and they feed on mites, insect and mite eggs, immature scales, and thrips. Lacewings. Green lacewings in the genera Chrysopa and Chrysoperla are common natural enemies of aphids and other soft-bodied insects. The gray-green to brown alligator-shaped larvae are the predatory stage. The green lacy-winged adults feed on honeydew. Lady beetles. Many different red and black lady beetle species are predators of aphids; the most common is the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens . Another common species in the garden is the Asian multicolored lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis . These lady beetles feed primarily on aphids and are predators in both the adult and larval stages. Look for the black, alligator-shaped larvae with orange dots and oblong, yellow lady beetle eggs that are laid on end in groups. Releases of commercially available convergent lady beetles can reduce aphid numbers. However, large numbers must be released on each individual rose plant. Mist lady beetles with a water spray before release. Make releases in the evening at dusk by placing beetles on canes at the base of plants. Wet plants first with a fine spray of water. Expect 90% of the lady beetles to fly away in the first 24 hours. The remaining lady beetles are unlikely to lay eggs and will fly away once aphid populations have been substantially reduced. Leatherwings or soldier beetles . These moderate to large-sized beetles in the cantharid family have leatherlike dark wings and orange or red heads and thoraxes. Several species feed on aphids and are very common on roses. Many people mistake soldier beetles for pests, but they can be important predators. Sometimes the beetles, which may feed on pollen and nectar as well as aphids, leave dark splotches of excrement on leaves. Soldier beetle larvae are also predaceous but live in the soil, feeding on soil-dwelling invertebrates. Syrphid flies. In their larval stage, syrphids, sometimes called flower flies or hover flies, are important predators of aphids and are very common on roses. Syrphid adults superficially resemble honey bees or wasps, feed on nectar and pollen before reproducing, and are often seen hovering above flowers. There are many species of hover flies in California. The aphid-feeding larvae, often found within aphid colonies, are legless and maggot-shaped and vary in color from dull brown or yellow to bright green; some species have a stripe down their backs. Don't mistake them for moth or butterfly caterpillars, which have legs and chew holes in leaves. Predaceous mites. A number of predatory mites feed on spider mites, often keeping them at tolerable levels. Predatory mites can be distinguished from the plant-feeding spider mites by the absence of the two spots on either side of the body, their pear shape, and their more active habits. Compared to the plant-feeding species of mites, which remain in one location feeding, predatory mites move rapidly around the leaf when looking for prey. Because they are so small, a hand lens is helpful in viewing them. Thrips . Sixspotted thrips, Eotetranychus sexmaculatus, feeds on spider mites. Western flower thrips are plant feeders but also feed on spider mites. While thrips damage may not be tolerated within commercial production, in landscape settings thrips may provide benefits outweighing the limited damage they cause. Spiders. All spiders are predators and many contribute significantly to biological control. Many types of spiders including crab spiders, jumping spiders, cobweb spiders, and orbweavers occur in landscapes.\",\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Spider mites are common pests of fruit trees, vegetables, berries, vines, and ornamental plants. Mites are tiny and difficult to see. Although related to insects, mites are arachnids just like spiders and ticks. If leaves are stippled with white dots or have webbing, check the undersides to see if spider mites are present. Sprays of water, insecticidal oils, or soaps can be used for management. Spider mites have many naturally occurring predators that often limit their numbers. What to look for: To the naked eye, spider mites look like tiny, moving dots. Use a magnifying lens to see them. Adults are less than 120 inch long and have eight legs, an oval body, and two colored eyespots near the end of the head. Spider mites live in colonies, mostly on the under surfaces of leaves; a single colony can contain hundreds of mites. When numbers are high, dense webbing can cover leaves, twigs, and fruit. Mites cause damage by sucking cell contents from leaves. A small number of mites isnt usually cause for concern, but very high populations can be damaging, especially to annual plants. Often, damage first appears as a stippling of light dots on the leaves; sometimes leaves turn a bronze color. Heavily infested leaves can turn yellow and drop off. Damage is usually most severe in hot, dusty conditions and on water-stressed plants. Protect predators of spider mites. Spider mites have many predators or natural enemies, which prevent them from becoming plant pests, especially when undisturbed by pesticide sprays. Key predators include predatory mites, which are about the same size as plant-feeding mites but have longer legs and are more active. Other common natural enemies include thrips, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Keep dust down. Plant ground covers, use mulches, and irrigate regularly. Avoid using insecticides that kill natural enemies. How do I control spider mites? Water plants sufficiently to avoid drought stress, which increases mites and mite damage. Most woody plants can tolerate low to moderate mite populations, and natural enemies are often abundant. If plants are infested, apply a water spray or mist to the undersides of leaves at least once a day. If you wish to use an insecticide, a good choice is an insecticidal oil or soap (or a combination of the two) applied so you completely cover the undersides of leaves. Be sure mites are present before treating. Dont spray when plants are water-stressed or if it is very hot. Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying persistent insecticides such as carbaryl or pyrethroids. These insecticides are not very effective against mites and often kill off natural enemies and stimulate mite reproduction. What about pesticides? If an insecticide is needed, use an insecticidal oil or insecticidal soap (or a combination of the two), applied so you completely cover the undersides of leaves. Be sure mites are present before treating. Dont spray when plants are water-stressed or if it is very hot. Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying persistent insecticides such as carbaryl or pyrethroids. These insecticides are not very effective against mites and often kill off predators and stimulate mite reproduction.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'There are two species of widow spiders in California, the western black widow and the brown widow. Both are in the genus Latrodectus and are characterized by a similar body shape, reclusive habit, and irregular cobwebs. The western black widow, a native species, is widespread, and is the spider posing the greatest potential envenomation threat to humans in the western United States. It is well known in many localities, and nonprofessionals can identify it easily. In the first decade of the 21st century, the non-native brown widow became established in southern California. Although it isn\\'t nearly as dangerous as the black widow, it causes alarm because of the reputation of its relative. BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS Several species of black widow are common in North America, but in the western United States the only species present is the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus. Its habitat ranges from British Columbia and Alberta to Mexico and throughout the Rocky Mountains to the western portions of the Great Plains. In California, it is a common desert spider that can survive very hot, dry conditions. However, black widows also can be found in mountainous terrain above 5,000-foot elevation in Southern California, where snow covers the ground every winter. Outside California, western black widows are common in urban Colorado, in central and eastern Washington state, and in southern British Columbia. Because the holes, cracks, crevices, trash, and clutter associated with human structures provide ideal habitat for the western black widow, these spiders are often very common around homes, barns, outbuildings, and rock walls. In such supportive habitats, mature females can be found every few feet and sometimes within inches of each other. Identification A mature female western black widow spider is about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in body length, and has a rounded abdomen and very characteristic coloration. She is shiny jet black all over her body and legs, except for a red pattern on the underside of the abdomen, which looks, in perfect specimens, like an hourglass. Some specimens have a brownish or plum-colored tinge, but usually these are females that are so well fed that the black-pigmented abdomen has been stretched until it looks brown instead of black. The red hourglass varies in appearance; it can be two perfect triangles with points merged to make a perfect hourglass, two triangles separated by a space, a triangle and a small bar, minimal or almost imperceptible red coloration, or, on rare occasions, completely absent. The false black widow, which is discussed below, is chocolate brown and never has red coloration, although many people frequently mistake it for a black widow. As easy as it is to identify an adult female black widow, the immatures, looking nothing like the mother, can be difficult to recognize. When black widow spiderlings emerge from their egg sac, they have tan legs and a tan cephalothorax (the body part to which the legs attach), while the abdomen is mostly white with a few black spots. As the spider grows, the background coloration of the abdomen becomes olive-gray or tan; and there is a longitudinal white stripe on the top of the abdomen and diagonal stripes on the flanks, with a small black dot at the uppermost portion of each diagonal stripe. As the spiderlings continue to grow larger, they molt, like all spiders, in order to shed their restrictive exoskeletons. With successive molts in females, the white stripes become thinner, the olive-gray or tan coloration darkens toward black, and eventually the spider acquires its well-known black coloration. Some mature females retain one or two conspicuous, indented white lines on the front surface of the abdomen that look like a corporal\\'s chevrons. In the youngest spiders, the space where the hourglass develops starts off being a whitish shield. As the spider grows and molts several times, the color of this shield turns from white-yellow to orange-red and changes from a shield with a thick middle portion to an hourglass with a thin, tapered middle. In contrast to the female, the male black widow retains the coloration of the juvenile. After it matures, it stops eating and its abdomen shrinks (its only task at this point is to mate). The male still retains one longitudinal abdominal stripe and a set of diagonal flank stripes on each side of the abdomen. The males are much smaller than the females in body length, although sometimes their legs are almost as long as those of the adult female. Egg Sac The egg sac of the western black widow is yellowish and teardrop-shaped, tapered at the top and bulbous at the bottom. The margins of the sac are well defined (as opposed to some spider egg sacs, which look like fluffy cotton balls, making it difficult to determine exactly where the egg sac starts). The egg sac covering is very tough and difficult to rip apart. A female western black widow typically lays about 300 eggs per sac. Because females can store sperm from their only mating, they can produce more than 10 egg sacs without subsequent matings and without a decrease in the number of eggs or a reduction in the percentage of eggs that will successfully hatch into spiderlings. Habitat The western black widow is found in populated areas almost everywhere in California. Although they can be found in homes, black widows typically nest outside, around the home in holes and crevices, and within clutter. In garages, they usually make webs by doors, near vents, and in other places where insects may pass by. Because most people don\\'t tolerate large numbers of insects in their living spaces, widow spiders usually won\\'t find sufficient prey to survive inside homes. Black widows are shy spiders that seek retreats, such as holes between bricks or spaces around pipe penetrations in walls, where they can hide during the day and then come out at night. In natural settings, you can often find them in rodent burrows and crevices in rock faces. The spider makes a web of tangled silk extending from this retreat hole. The web doesn\\'t have a very recognizable pattern, although it does have vertical support threads above and below the central areas where the spider sits while it waits for prey at night. The lower support threads also alert the widow to the presence of a prey item blundering into the web. In most cases, a widow spider will seek a retreat near the ground as the home base for her web, which connects to the retreat, allowing the spider to emerge to catch both flying and crawling prey at night, usually within three feet of the ground. However, some spiders will make a retreat well above ground level, such as in the eave of a house, and then drop down 10 or more feet before building their web. Widow spiders come out at dusk. After making improvements to their existing web, they take up a position in the middle, their underside facing upward, to wait for prey. Any large disturbance of the web that indicates something larger than a prey item causes the spider to quickly move toward the safety of its retreat. The silk of a mature black widow is very strong. If you run your finger through the web of a large spider, the result is an audible ripping sound. Black widow silk is so strong that during World War II, it was used to make crosshairs for gun sights. Medical Aspects Bites from black widow spiders are quite rare, even where these spiders are very common. In the unlikely event of an actual bite from a black widow, the bite itself is painless or may feel like a little pinprick. Almost all medically important black widow bites are from the adult female, which is much larger than the male. The female also has stronger biting muscles and a larger venom reserve. At the site of the bite, there may be a little red mark or red streaking away from the bite. Within an hour, other symptoms may start to appear. Bite victims might suffer from some but not all of the following symptoms: Rigid stomach muscles, which some medical professionals have misdiagnosed as appendicitis Sweating, sometimes of just the bitten body part, such as a bite to the hand that results in only the arm sweating profusely Pain that can be local, radiating, or regional Urine retention Numbness, agitation, fever, and patchy paralysis (less common) Another sign of envenomation is that bite victims will sometimes move or rock back and forth incessantly to try to lessen the pain from the venom injection process. Although these are the most severe manifestations of black widow bites, symptoms most often merely resemble those of the flu. Black widow bites don\\'t cause conspicuous swelling, necrosis, or deterioration of tissue around the bite. As a neurotoxin, the venom of a black widow affects the nerve-muscle junction in the body. Normally, the body\\'s neurons work like a light switch: they make the muscle turn on and then off again so that the muscle can relax and be ready to contract again if needed. The venom causes the muscle to repeatedly contract. It would be like flipping on a light switch and not being able to turn it off again. If bitten, seek medical attention immediately. You can place a cold pack on the bite to relieve the pain. An antivenom for black widow bites is available that works for all species that have been tested worldwide. Response is fast, and bite victims can go from intense pain back to normal in 30 minutes. The antivenom is based on horse serum, so physicians need to monitor for anaphylactic shock. American physicians are somewhat reluctant to use antivenom for this reason and might prefer to have the bite victim simply endure the symptoms, which can be similar to those of a bad flu episode and usually dissipate in a few days. BROWN WIDOW SPIDERS The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is found worldwide in subtropical habitats. It probably originated from Africa, or possibly from South America. In North America, the brown widow was found only in Florida for many decades, where it remains rather common. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the spider began appearing elsewhere, from Texas throughout the Gulf Coast states and up the Atlantic coast into South Carolina. While they were expanding in the southeastern United States, brown widows started being discovered in great numbers in Southern California, where they have caused great concern within the general public. Initial news reports exaggerated the impact of the brown widow. However, unlike that of the black widow, the bite of this spider is not much more toxic to humans than that of other common spiders. Identification Mature female brown widows are smaller than mature female western black widows, being about 3/8\" in body length (10 mm). The normal brown widow spider coloration is a mottled collection of tan, brown, and gray. It has a lengthwise stripe halfway up the back side of the abdomen with two isolated dots in front of it and diagonal stripes on the side, somewhat similar to immature western black widow spiders (see Table 1). However, the usual background coloration of the brown widow is more of a tan, as compared to the western black widow, in which background coloration is more olive-gray. Male brown widows are much smaller [body length: 3/16 inch (4 to 5 mm)] than other widow spiders and therefore might be overlooked or misidentified. There is, however, great variation in brown widow coloration. Spiders can vary from almost white to almost black. When brown widows are very dark, though, this coloration is closer to a flat black than a shiny black like that of a mature black widow female. A mature brown widow female looks very similar to an immature western black widow, thus some skill is needed to identify the two accurately. However, the brown widow egg sac, as described in the next paragraph, is distinctive and a much surer way to confirm the species. Table 1. Features used to distinguish brown widows from immature western black widows. Feature Brown widow Black widow (immature) Black spots on lateral abdominal stripes large, squarish small, elliptical Hourglass bottom half larger top half larger rough margins crisp, straight margins White markings on front of abdomen not continuous continuous Egg Sac The egg sac of the brown widow spider has protuberances of silk all over its surface, resembling a very large pollen grain. The sac is so characteristic that it can be used to verify the presence of brown widows even if the spiders themselves are not seen. Brown widows produce about 130 eggs per egg sac and are able to make 20 or more egg sacs in a lifetime, sometimes multiple sacs within a short time period. Female brown widows can be collected with several simultaneously-developing egg sacs. Habitat The habitat of the brown widow is similar in many respects to that of the black widow. They generally reside in cluttered areas outside, such as woodpiles, but you will also find them in more exposed areas, such as on chain-link fences where black widows normally would not be found. They are also extremely common in the nooks and crannies on the undersides of inexpensive plastic patio furniture. Brown widow spiders make irregular webs of strong silk, similar to those of western black widows. Both black widows and brown widows are almost never found in homes. In garages, black widows are common but brown widows are not. Outside and around the home, both spiders are very common. The brown widow appears to be displacing the black widow in some of its habitats, especially in urban areas. Southern California residents frequently mention that they used to have a few black widows, but now only can find brown widows (and in greater numbers). In a study published in 2012, brown widows outnumbered black widows in urban areas; such as around homes, in parks (especially under playground equipment), in zoos, etc. The same study, however, reported that brown widows were not found in natural areas in southern California (such as in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat) and were rare around agricultural buildings. Brown widows were occasionally found in agricultural crops such as citrus, apple, and avocado trees as well as in corn stalks, bird-of-paradise leaves and other plants, but most of these finds were in vegetation associated with small home gardens rather than large commercial properties. As of 2016, brown widows were well established from Santa Barbara to the San Bernardino area and south to Mexico. Established populations have not yet been found north of the Los Angeles Basin, in the Central Valley, or in the desert areas (which may be inhospitable for them due to the arid climate). Although unsubstantiated reports of brown widows occurring north of the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara region (such as in the San Francisco Bay area) have been made for years, submitted spiders have been immature black widows, Steatoda (false black widow) spiders of several species, or orbweavers. However, it is possible that the brown widow is continuing to expand its range in California. Medical Aspects The bite of the brown widow is much milder than that of the western black widow. In a study in Africa, the most common symptoms in 15 verified bites were that the bite hurt when it happened and that there was burning pain at the bite site. None of these patients developed the typical dynamic symptoms of black widow envenomation. Despite these observations, there is one American record of a verified bite where the patient developed more severe symptoms and required hospitalization. Although its venom is at least as potent as black widow venom (drop for drop, as tested in mice), the brown widow is smaller and likely injects much less venom during a bite. In addition, bites to people are unlikely since brown widows, when disturbed, typically pull their legs close to the body, drop from their web, and play dead. The recent arrival of the brown widow in Southern California is not a cause for alarm. In fact, if the brown widow is indeed displacing the more toxic black widow, there actually might be a reduction in spider bite risk as compared to previous decades. OTHER RELATED SPIDERS False Black Widow The false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, is not a true widow spider; however, it is in the same family, Theridiidae, as widow spiders and can easily be confused with them. It shares the same rounded-abdomen body form and web-making traits. It is slightly smaller than a mature western black widow spider [body length: 3/8 inch (10 mm)], chocolate brown in color, and never has red coloration on its belly. The false black widow is a European immigrant that has become extremely common in Pacific Coast homes from San Diego to British Columbia, with isolated finds in Alaska. Unlike black widows, false black widow spiders thrive indoors, especially in washrooms, inside cupboards and underneath appliances, furniture and cabinets. False black widows make an egg sac that looks like a cotton ball with indistinct margins. Unlike black widow spiders, false black widow spiderlings are dark like their mothers when they emerge. Because they are common in homes, false black widows are more frequently involved in bite incidents than black widow or brown widow spiders. They have mild venom, and bites may cause symptoms similar to those of yellowjacket wasp stings: initial burning pain followed by minor localized swelling around the envenomation site. When black widow antivenom mistakenly has been used on false black widow bites, it appeared to eliminate the venom\\'s effects. Noble False Widow Spider In 2011, Steatoda nobilis was discovered in Southern California. Like the false black widow, this spider is a European native. Mature females can reach 5/8 inch (14 mm) in body length, which is significantly larger than the false black widow. Instead of being uniformly colored on the top surface of the abdomen as is the false black widow, Steatoda nobilis usually has a light tan pattern somewhat resembling a house with two windows and a domed roof. However, in some specimens, only the remnant tip of the \"roof\" is exhibited. There is also a broad, tan band on the front-facing surface of the abdomen. This spider was first found in Ventura County. It is now widespread in coastal San Diego County, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay area. Isolated finds have occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Bites from this species are not considered to be medically significant. There have been two recorded bites from the spider, with minor symptom development, but because of its large size, it has the potential to hurt merely from fang penetration. This spider will probably continue to spread throughout coastal California.',\n",

       "       'management': \"Minimizing sites around the home where spiders may hide, such as clutter, woodpiles, and heavy ground cover, is essential for reducing widow spider populations. However, it is not practical to eliminate these spiders completely. Both widow species will continue to re-infest treated areas. Regularly vacuuming or sweeping windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, and other seldom-used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually don't survive this process. In the garage, keep items such as gardening clothes and gloves in bags closed with zipper-locks or twist ties. Store seasonal items such as sports gear, camping gear, winter clothes or holiday decorations in boxes that can be taped shut and placed off the floor away from walls in order to exclude spiders. When cleaning up clutter in garages and other storage areas, be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Other areas to check carefully include children's toys or playhouses made of molded plastic that have open spaces facing downward where spiders can crawl in. Additional favored habitats of widow spiders include picnic tables, trash can grips, lawn chairs, plant pots with curled lips, and other outdoor objects with sheltered lips or crevices. Be careful that you do not carry spiders indoors on items such as plants, firewood, and boxes. Stack woodpiles away from your house, and never pick up pieces of wood unless you are wearing gloves. Eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping areas near building foundations free of trash, leaf litter, and accumulations of other materials. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attract spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures pointed off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides do not provide long-term control. Because widow spiders are nocturnal, a nonchemical method of eradication is to search for them at night with a flashlight and kill them with a shoe or rolled up newspaper. If you are concerned about wildlife and feel comfortable doing so, you can remove individual spiders from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper underneath to seal off the opening when you lift the jar. Release the spider about 100 feet from your home into a natural area. Brown widows may not survive in natural areas but on the other hand, they are an invasive, non-native pest species and should not be there anyway. One aspect that makes controlling widow spiders difficult is that they, like many spiders, exhibit a behavior called ballooning. When the spiderlings are very small, on warm days when there is an updraft, they climb to the top of a fence post or piece of vegetation, raise their abdomens into the air, and release a small filament of silk. When the updraft currents overtake the forces of gravity, the spiderling is carried into the air to another location. This may only be a few feet away, or it could be miles. Ballooning spiderlings have been captured at 10,000 feet from the ground and 200 miles offshore. Because spiderlings will be dropping down on your property continually, eliminating them will be a task that needs to be done repeatedly throughout the year. Chemical Control Typically, control of spiders using pesticides is difficult. Various insecticides are registered for control of spiders; including pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and combinations of these products. Curiously, most of these registered pesticides are water-based while the silk of spider egg sacs repels water. In a 2016 study, water-based insecticides sprayed on brown widow egg sacs provided no significant effect on the egg contents. However, when petroleum-based products were used, the pesticide was readily carried past the silk outer layer and killed the egg sac contents.\"},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'A parasite is an organism that lives and feeds in or on a larger animal (host). Nearly all insect pests have at least one parasite that attacks them. Insects that parasitize other invertebrates are parasitic only in their immature stages and kill their host just as they reach maturity. Most insect parasites (sometimes called parasitoids) are host-specific wasps or flies, and many are so small that often you wont see them. An adult parasite can lay eggs in hundreds of host individuals, resulting in the reduction of pest numbers. Life cycle of an aphid parasite (left). The adult female wasp (right) lays one egg in each aphid host; the egg develops into a larva, which feeds inside of and kills the aphid. The wasp larva pupates then emerges as an adult wasp. Parasitized aphids (left) die and turn into crusty \"mummies\" that can be black or beige. The hole in the aphid mummy (right) indicates a parasite has emerged. The blackish scale insects on the twig at left are discolored because wasp larvae are developing within. Once parasites mature into adults, they emerge through an exit hole (right). Some whitefly parasites turn hosts black; others do not. A good way to detect parasitization is to look for round exit holes in nymphs. A T-shaped slit indicates that a healthy whitefly emerged (far left). A circular hole indicates a parasite emerged (right). Caterpillar parasites include the Hyposoter exiguae wasp laying an egg in an armyworm (left). Pulling apart parasitized caterpillars can reveal the wasp larva within (right). Other signs of parasitized caterpillars: A Cotesia wasp forms white cocoons (left) outside its redhumped caterpillar host; at right, redhumped caterpillars are discolored and distorted due to a Hyposoter wasp pupating within. Some parasites, such as this Goniozus legneri on a navel orangeworm (left), lay many eggs externally on a host resulting in multiple wasp larvae feeding on a single caterpillar (right). Some parasites attack insect eggs, such as the Trissolcus wasp at left laying eggs in a stink bug egg cluster. The black corn earworm egg at right is dark because a Trichogramma wasp larva is developing inside. White eggs are healthy. Tachinid flies (left) parasitize many types of insects. Tachinid eggs laid on the caterpillar at right will hatch and, as larvae, bore into the host. Some tachinids lay eggs on plants and enter their insect hosts by being eaten.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Because of their relatively large size and unusual appearance, Jerusalem crickets (family Stenopelmatidae) are commonly brought to entomologists for identification. They have many common names, including nias de la tierra (children of the earth) and sand crickets. They also are sometimes called potato bugs because they are occasional pests of potatoes, but the name potato bug is confusing because it is applied to several different invertebrates, including Colorado potato beetle, pillbugs, sowbugs, and Jerusalem crickets, none of which are true bugs (Heteroptera). Jerusalem crickets feed and tunnel underground during the day and can occur aboveground mostly at night. They are most often seen when exposed by gardeners turning the soil or above ground after heavy irrigation or rainfall, at night, or at twilight during mild weather. They are easily recognized by their bald, round, humanoid head and fat orangish abdomen with black rings. They have long, brownish antennae and spiny hind legs and lack wings. They grow up to about 2 inches long. Nymphs (immatures) look like small adults. Jerusalem crickets hatch from eggs laid in soil and spend much of their time underground. Nymphs molt up to about 10 times before becoming reproductive adults. Their life span can be up to about 2 years. Jerusalem crickets are harmless to people and woody plants. Their food includes insects, nonwoody roots, and tubers. They only occasionally damage turf and vegetables. Aside from their alarming appearance, they generally are not pests. No control is necessary for Jerusalem crickets. They may be important food for certain vertebrate predators. If found where they are not desired, they can be scooped into a box and thrown away.

       "      'body': {'description': 'Mites are common pests in landscapes and gardens that feed on many fruit trees, vines, berries, vegetables, and ornamental plants. Although related to insects, mites arent insects but members of the arachnid class along with spiders and ticks. Spider mites (Figure 1), also called webspinning mites, are the most common mite pests and among the most ubiquitous of all pests in the garden and on the farm. Webspinning spider mites include the Pacific spider mite, twospotted spider mite, strawberry spider mite, and several other species. Most common ones are closely related species in the Tetranychus genus and cant be reliably distinguished in the field. However, there is little need to do so, since their damage, biology, and management are virtually the same. To the naked eye, spider mites look like tiny, moving dots; however, you can see them easily with a 10X hand lens. Adult females, the largest forms, are less than 1/20 inch long. Spider mites live in colonies, mostly on the undersurfaces of leaves; a single colony may contain hundreds of individuals (Figure 2). The names spider mite and webspinning mite come from the silk webbing most species produce on infested leaves (Figure 3). The presence of webbing is an easy way to distinguish them from all other types of mites and small insects such as aphids and thrips, which can also infest leaf undersides. Adult mites have eight legs and an oval body with two red eyespots near the head end. Females usually have a large, dark blotch on each side of the body and numerous bristles covering the legs and body. Immatures resemble adults (except they are much smaller), and the newly hatched larvae have only six legs. The other immature stages have eight legs. Eggs are spherical and translucent, like tiny droplets, becoming cream colored before hatching (Figure 4).',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'In some parts of California, spider mites may feed and reproduce all year on plants that retain their green leaves throughout the winter. In colder areas and on deciduous trees that drop their leaves, webspinning mites overwinter as red or orange mated females under rough bark scales and in ground litter and trash. They begin feeding and laying eggs when warm weather returns in spring. Spider mites reproduce rapidly in hot weather and commonly become numerous in June through September. If the temperature and food supplies are favorable, a generation can be completed in less than a week (Figure 5). Spider mites prefer hot, dusty conditions and usually are first found on trees or plants adjacent to dusty roadways or at margins of gardens. Plants under water stress also are highly susceptible. As foliage quality declines on heavily infested plants, female mites catch wind currents and disperse to other plants. High mite populations may undergo a rapid decline in late summer when predators overtake them, host plant conditions become unfavorable, and the weather turns cooler as well as following rain.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Mites cause damage by sucking cell contents from leaves. A small number of mites usually isnt reason for concern, but very high populationslevels high enough to show visible damage to leavescan damage plants, especially herbaceous ones. At first, the damage shows up as a stippling of light dots on the leaves; sometimes the leaves take on a bronze color. As feeding continues, the leaves turn yellowish or reddish and drop off. Often, large amounts of webbing cover leaves, twigs, and fruit. Damage is usually worse when compounded by water stress. Loss of leaves wont cause yield losses in fruit trees during the year of infestation unless it occurs in spring or very early summer, but it may impact next years crop. On annual vegetable cropssuch as squash, melons, and watermelonsloss of leaves can have a significant impact on yield and lead to sunburning. On crops such as sugar peas and beans, where pods are attacked, spider mites can cause direct damage. On ornamentals, mites are primarily an aesthetic concern, but they can kill plants if populations become very high on annual plants. Spider mites are also important pests of field-grown roses.',\n",
       "       'management': 'Spider mites have many natural enemies that often limit populations. Adequate irrigation is important, because water-stressed plants are most likely to be damaged. Broad-spectrum insecticide treatments for other pests frequently cause mite outbreaks, so avoid these pesticides when possible. Sprays of water, insecticidal oils, or soaps can be used for management. Always monitor mite levels before treatment. Monitoring Mites are tiny and difficult to detect. Youll usually notice plant damage such as stippled or yellow leaves before you spot the mites themselves (Figure 6). Check the undersides of leaves for mites, their eggs, and webbing; youll need a hand lens to identify them. To observe mites more closely, shake a few off the leaf surface onto a white sheet of paper. Once disturbed, they will move around rapidly. Be sure mites are present before you treat. Sometimes the mites will be gone by the time you notice the damage; plants will often recover after mites have left. Biological Control Spider mites have many natural enemies, which limit their numbers in many landscapes and gardens, especially when undisturbed by pesticide sprays. Some of the most important are the predatory mites, including the western predatory mite (Figure 7), Galendromus (formerly Metaseiulus) occidentalis, and Phytoseiulus mite species. Predatory mites are about the same size as plant-feeding mites but have longer legs and are more active; they also are more teardrop-shaped than spider mites. Various other insects are also important predatorssixspotted thrips (Scolothrips sexmaculatus) (Figure 8), the larvae and adults of the spider mite destroyer lady beetle (Stethorus picipes), the larvae of certain flies including the cecidomyid Feltiella acarivora (Figure 9), and various general predators such as minute pirate bugs, bigeyed bugs, and lacewing larvae. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, can be an important predator on spider mite eggs and larvae, but this species will also inflict severe damage to plants if mites arent present on which to feed. The purchase and release of predatory mites can be useful in establishing populations in large plantings or orchards, but the best results are obtained by creating favorable conditions for naturally occurring predators, such as avoiding dusty conditions and insecticide sprays. The major predator mites commercially available for release are the western predatory mite and Phytoseiulus. The western predatory mite is more effective under hot, dry conditions. These predators dont feed on foliage or become pests; thus if pest mites arent available when predatory mites are released, the predators starve or migrate elsewhere. If you wish to establish predators in a heavily infested orchard or garden that has few predators, use a soap spray or selective miticide to bring pest mites to a lower level and then release predatory mites. A good guideline is that one predator is needed for every 10 spider mites to provide control. More than one application of predatory mites may be required if you want to reduce pest populations rapidly. Concentrate releases in hot spots where spider mite numbers are highest. Once established on perennials, predatory mites may reproduce and provide biological control indefinitely without further augmentation unless nonselective insecticides are applied that kill the predators. Cultural Control Cultural practices can have a significant impact on spider mites. Dusty conditions often lead to mite outbreaks. Apply water to pathways and other dusty areas at regular intervals. Water-stressed trees and plants are less tolerant of spider mite damage. Be sure to provide adequate irrigation. Midseason washing of trees and vines with water to remove dust may help prevent serious late-season mite infestations. In gardens and on small fruit trees, regular, forceful spraying of plants with water often will reduce spider mite numbers adequately. Be sure to get good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. If more control is required, use an insecticidal soap or oil in your spray, but test the product on one or two plants to be sure it isnt damaging to them. (See Chemical Control below.) Chemical Control Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying insecticides. Such outbreaks are commonly a result of the insecticide killing off the mites natural enemies but also occur when certain insecticides stimulate mite reproduction. For example, spider mites exposed to carbaryl (Sevin) in the laboratory have been shown to reproduce faster than untreated populations. Carbaryl, some organophosphates, and some pyrethroids apparently also favor spider mites by increasing the level of nitrogen in leaves. Insecticides applied during hot weather usually appear to have the greatest effect, causing dramatic spider mite outbreaks within a few days. If a treatment for mites is necessary, use selective materials, preferably insecticidal soap or insecticidal oil. Both petroleum-based horticultural oils and plant-based oils such as neem, canola, or cottonseed oils are acceptable. There are also a number of plant extracts formulated as acaricides (a pesticide that kills mites) that exert an effect on spider mites. These include garlic extract, clove oil, mint oils, rosemary oil, cinnamon oil and others. Dont use soaps or oils on water-stressed plants or when temperatures exceed 90F. These materials may injure some plants, so check labels and/or test them out on a portion of the foliage several days before applying a full treatment. Oils and soaps must contact mites to kill them, so excellent coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, is essential, and repeat applications may be required. Sulfur sprays can be used on some vegetables, fruit trees, and ornamentals. This product will burn cucurbits and other plants in some cases. Dont use sulfur unless it has been shown to be safe for that plant in your locality. Use liquid products such as sulfur and potash soap combinations (e.g., Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray) rather than sulfur dusts, which drift easily and can be breathed in. Dont use sulfur if temperatures exceed 90F, and dont apply sulfur within 30 days of an oil spray. Sulfur is a skin irritant and eye and respiratory hazard, so always wear appropriate protective clothing.'},\n",

Spiders that might injure peoplefor example, black widowsgenerally spend most of their time hidden under furniture or boxes, or in woodpiles, corners, or crevices. The spiders commonly seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people.',\n",

       "       'development': 'Spiders resemble insects and sometimes are confused with them, but they are arachnids, not insects. Spiders have eight legs and two body partsa head region (cephalothorax) and an abdomen. They lack wings and antennae. Although spiders often are found on plants, they eat mainly insects, other spiders, and related arthropods, not plants. Most spiders have toxic venom, which they use to kill their prey. However, only those spiders whose venom typically causes a serious reaction in humans are called poisonous spiders. See the sidebar: Spider Bites. Table 1. Common Spider Families in North America. Agelenidae, funnel weavers or grass spiders Sit-and-wait predators feed during the day and night on the ground in most types of vegetation, including low-growing plants and trees. Spin funnel-shaped webs, often with several-inch-wide, flat extension covering plants or soil. The spider waits in the hole of its web. When it detects vibrations from an insect that flew or walked into the web, the spider runs out, captures and bites the prey, then carries it back into the funnel to be eaten. Webs on low vegetation become conspicuous in morning light after collecting dew. Funnel weavers have six or eight eyes, all about the same size, arranged in two rows. About 300 species in North America. Araneidae, orb weavers or garden spiders Feed on insects that fly, fall, or are blown into web. Elaborate silken webs are spun in concentric circles. Spiderlings often make symmetrical webs; mature spiders may spin a more specialized design that is helpful in identifying certain species. The spider rests at the center of its web or hides in a shelter near the edge, waiting for prey to become entangled. Orb weavers generally have poor vision and rely on web vibrations to locate and identify prey. About 200 species in North America. Clubionidae (including Corinnidae), sac spiders or twoclawed hunting spiders Stalk and capture prey that is walking or resting on surfaces. They spin silken tubes or sacs under bark, among leaves, and in low plants or on the ground, where they hide during the day or retreat after hunting. Commonly are nocturnal, medium-sized, pale spiders with few markings. About 200 species in North America. Linyphiidae (=Microphantidae), dwarf spiders Prey on insects that fall, walk, or land in their web. Diurnal (day active) spiders occurring in the plant canopy and among litter on the ground. They produce sheetlike webs on the surface of plants or soil and are common in some field and vegetable crops. Most are relatively small. Several hundred species in North America. Lycosidae, wolf spiders Prey on insects that are walking or resting on the ground. Actively hunt in the open during the day and night, often observed on the ground in litter and on low vegetation. Can occur in burrows and under debris on soil. Instead of spinning webs to catch prey, make a small, thick web where they rest. Have a distinctive pattern of eyes: four small eyes in front in a straight row, one middle pair of larger eyes, and one rear pair of widely spaced eyes on top of the head. They have long hairy legs. They are usually black and white or strongly contrasting light and dark, which can make them difficult to discern unless they are moving. About 200 species in North America. Oxyopidae, lynx spiders Stalk and capture resting or walking insects. Active hunters with good vision. Most have spiny legs and a brightly colored body that tapers sharply toward the rear. They have four pairs of eyes grouped in a hexagon. About 2 dozen known species in North America. Salticidae, jumping spiders Day-active hunters in plants or on the ground. They make no web; instead they stalk and pounce on prey by jumping distances many times their body length. Jumping spiders have a distinctive pattern of eyes in three rows: the first row of four eyes, with large and distinctive middle eyes; a second row of two very small to minute eyes; and a third row of two medium sized eyes. They usually have an iridescent, metallic-colored abdomen and black carapace. About 300 species in North America. Theridiidae, cobweb, cobweb weaver, or combfooted spiders Feed on insects that walk or fly into their webs. Almost always found hanging upside down by their claws in irregularly spun, sticky webs, waiting for prey. The spider is usually concealed in a corner of the web, in a silken tent, or behind debris. This group includes the black widow spider, which produces relatively thick silk that feels rough and sticky. They generally have a soft, round, bulbous abdomen and slender legs without spines. Over 200 species in North America. Thomisidae, crab spiders or flower spiders Stalk and capture insects walking or resting on surfaces. Diurnal hunters that do not spin webs. Front two pairs of legs are enlarged and extend beyond the side of their flattened body, making them look like tiny crabs. Their small eyes occur in two slightly curved rows, with the top row often much wider than the lower row. Over 200 species in North America. Black Widow Spider The black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most common harmful spider in California. Venom from its bite can cause reactions ranging from mild to painful and serious, but death is very unlikely and many symptoms can be alleviated if medical treatment is obtained. Anyone bitten by this spider should remain calm and promptly seek medical advice; it is helpful if the offending spider can be caught and saved for identification. The typical adult female black widow has a shiny black body, slender black legs, and a red or orange mark in the shape of an hourglass on the underside of the large, round abdomen. The body, excluding legs, is 5/16 to 5/8 inch long. Only the larger immature female and adult female spiders are able to bite through a persons skin and inject enough venom to cause a painful reaction. The adult male black widow is one-half to two-thirds the length of the female, has a small abdomen, and is seldom noticed. The male black widow does possess venom, but its fangs are too small to break human skin. The top side of its abdomen is olive-greenish gray with a pattern of cream-colored areas and one light-colored band going lengthwise down the middle. The hourglass mark on the underside of the abdomen typically is yellow or yellow-orange and broad waisted. The legs are banded with alternating light and dark areas. Contrary to popular belief, the female black widow rarely eats the male after mating but may do so if hungry. Like males, young female black widow spiders are patterned on the top side. In the early stages they greatly resemble males but gradually acquire the typical female coloration with each shedding of the skin. In intermediate stages they have tan or cream-colored, olive-gray, and orange markings on the top side of the abdomen, a yellowish orange hourglass mark on the underside, and banded legs. Webs and Egg Sacs The web of the black widow is an irregular, tough-stranded, sticky cobweb mesh in which the spider hangs with its underside up. During the day it often hides under an object at the edge of the web or stays in a silken retreat in the center. The black widow may rush out of its hiding place when the web is disturbed, especially if egg sacs are present. The egg sacs are mostly spherical, about 1/2 inch long and 5/8 inch in diameter, creamy yellow to light tan in color, opaque, and tough and paperlike on the surface. A female may produce several egg sacs. Tiny, young black widows, which are nearly white in color, disperse to new locations by ballooning and infest new areas. Spider Bites Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-222-1222). Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, apply an antiseptic to prevent infection, and use ice or ice water to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary, try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist. Where the Spiders Live. Black widow spiders occur in most parts of California. They and their associated webs usually are found in dark, dry, sheltered, relatively undisturbed places such as among piles of wood, rubbish, or stones; in culverts, hollow stumps, and old animal burrows; in garages, sheds, barns, crawl spaces, utility meter boxes, and outhouses; and sometimes among plants. People are most likely to be bitten when they disturb the spider while they are cleaning out or picking up items in such places. A sensible precaution is to always wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt when working in areas that have been undisturbed for a time and where there are good hiding places for spiders. Effects of the Bite. The symptoms of a black widow bite are largely internal; little more than local redness and swelling may develop at the bite site. The internal effects may range from mild to severe. Pain tends to spread from the bite to other parts of the body and muscular spasms may develop. In severe cases the abdominal muscles may become quite rigid. Other effects can include profuse sweating, fever, increased blood pressure, difficulty breathing and speaking, restlessness, and nausea. Typically, the pain and other symptoms reach a maximum within a day of the bite, then gradually subside over the next 2 to 3 days. Most people who are bitten spend a few hours under observation by a physician but do not develop symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Small children, the elderly, and persons with health problems are likely to suffer some of the more severe consequences of the bite. Black widow bites are fairly common in California. Yellow Sac Spider The common, house-dwelling agrarian sac or yellow sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum, is a small spider that spins a silken sac web in the corners of ceilings and walls, and behind shelves and pictures; it is also commonly found outdoors in shrubbery. This spider is light yellow and has a slightly darker stripe on the upper middle of the abdomen. The eight eyes of this spider are all about equal in size and arranged in two horizontal rows. Yellow sac spiders can be seen running on walls and ceilings at night and quickly drop to the floor to escape if they are disturbed. Bites usually occur when the spider becomes trapped against a persons skin in clothing or bedding. It is estimated that sac spiders are responsible for more bites on people than any other spider. Typical symptoms of a bite include initial pain, redness, and sometimes swelling. Recluse Spiders Recluse spiders of the genus Loxosceles include the well-known brown recluse spider, L. reclusa, which does not occur in California. While the brown recluse has occasionally been brought into California in household furnishings, firewood, and motor vehicles, it does not reside in the state. However, populations of another recluse spider, the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta), were found in Los Angeles County in the late 1960s. In its native Chile it is known to have a bite that is toxic to humans. The native recluse spider of California (L. deserta) is found in the desert regions of southern California and neighboring states. Its bite can cause problems, but it is not as toxic as that of the Chilean recluse. In any case, bites from the desert recluse are rare and no bites from the Chilean recluse have ever been recorded in California despite its presence in heavily populated urban areas. Both the native desert recluse spider and the Chilean recluse spider occur principally in the drier areas of southern California. Recluse spiders can have a violin-shaped mark (with the neck of the violin pointing backward) on the top side of the head region (cephalothorax). However, the mark is not always distinct, so it should not be used as an identifying character. A unique feature of recluse spiders is their six eyes, arranged in pairs in a semicircle, which can be seen with the use of a good hand lens. Most other spiders have eight eyes. All recluse spiders make large, irregular, flattened, cobweb-type webs with thick strands extending in all directions. These spiders avoid light, are active at night, and tend to build their webs in out-of-the-way places. Chilean recluse spiders may be found indoors in boxes, in corners, behind pictures, in old clothing hanging undisturbed, and in other similar places. Desert recluse spiders appear outdoors where they may be found under rocks or wood. More detailed information on these spiders is available in Pest Notes: Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders . Other Spiders In addition to the species mentioned above, there are only a few other species of spiders in California that may on occasion bite humans. (Remember, if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician). One kind of red and black jumping spider, Phidippus johnsoni, may bite if it is disturbed, but the bites are usually not serious. The female spiders are black with red on the top side of the abdomen whereas the males are all red. These spiders range in size from 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Tarantulas are long-lived spiders that occupy burrows in the ground during the day but often come out at night to hunt insects near the burrow. They commonly are feared because of their large size and hairy appearance. Some poisonous tarantulas occur in tropical parts of the world, but the bites of California tarantulas are not likely to be seriousat worst, they are similar to a bee sting. However, because of the variety of tarantulas sold in the pet trade industry, there is a spectrum of venom potencies among these creatures. These spiders ranges from 1 to 2 inches in body size. The hobo spider, Tegenaria agrestis, also called the aggressive house spider, is a common spider in the Pacific Northwest. It builds funnel-shaped webs in dark, moist areas such as basements, window wells, wood piles, and around the perimeter of homes. It is a large (1 to 13/4 inch, including legs), fast-running brown spider with a herringbone or multiple chevron pattern on the top of the abdomen. The hobo spider has not been documented in California, but it has expanded its range from the Pacific Northwest to northern Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Although it has been stated as being a poisonous spider, recent research is challenging the original data that elevated this spider to medical importance. See Pest Notes: Hobo Spiders . One spider frequently found indoors is the common house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, which makes a cobweb in corners of rooms, in windows, and in similar places. Another is the marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, which was introduced into the state in the 1970s and has since displaced the once common longbodied cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides, a long-legged spider that resembles a daddy-longlegs. These spiders are only marginally capable of biting humans because their fangs are too short to pierce peoples skin; they primarily cause problems by producing messy cobwebs. Various kinds of small hunting spiders may wander indoors and occasionally, rather large, hunting-type spiders are discovered in homes or garages. Often these are fully grown wolf spider or tarantula males that have reached maturity and are searching for females. When these spiders are wandering, one or more may accidentally get indoors. New houses and other structures in developments may be invaded by wolf spiders that have lost their usual outdoor living places. The more insects that exist inside a building, the more likely it is to have spiders living there. Usually spiders are most abundant in fall following the first few rains of the season. Immature and adult female burrow-living spiders sometimes wander for a time during the rainy season if they have had to abandon wet burrows.',\n",

       "       'management': 'Spiders may enter houses and other structures through cracks and other openings. They also may be carried in on items like plants, firewood, and boxes. To prevent spiders from coming indoors, seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors. Good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they prey upon. Regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, basements, and other seldom used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive the tumbling process through the hose. Indoors, a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider because occupied spider webs are maintained for cleanliness to enhance prey capture. Individual spiders can also be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. They can then be released outdoors. Watch this video to learn more: How to catch a spider. In indoor storage areas, place boxes off the floor and away from walls, whenever possible, to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders. Sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within. Clean up clutter in garages, sheds, basements, and other storage areas. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Outdoors, eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash, leaf litter, heavy vegetation, and other accumulations of materials. Trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attracts spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Chemical Control: Insecticides will not provide long-term control and should not generally be used against spiders outdoors. Typically, controlling spiders with pesticides is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control, including pyrethrins and pyrethroids (synthetic versions of pyrethrins) such as resmethrin, allethrin, or combinations of these products. Control by spraying is only temporary unless accompanied by housekeeping. It is just as easy and much less toxic to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe or to vacuum it up. Sticky traps offer a noninsecticidal way to remove spiders from your home as long as you can place the traps where pets and children cant tamper with them. Sorptive dusts containing amorphous silica gel (silica aerogel) and pyrethrins, which can be applied by professional pest control applicators only, may be useful in certain indoor situations. Sorptive dust particles affect the outer covering of spiders (and also insects) that have crawled over a treated surface, causing them to dry out and die. When applied as a dustlike film and left in place, a sorptive dust provides permanent protection against spiders. The dust is most safely and effectively used in cracks and crevices and in attics, wall voids, and other enclosed or unused places. SPIDER BITES: Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically, the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-876-4766 or 1-800-8-POISON). One must also keep in mind that although it is impossible to be certain, people and their physicians often blame spiders as the cause of skin lesions with no proof of spider involvement when there are many similar-appearing, non-spider maladies; therefore, care must be exerted in the diagnostic process. Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, and use ice, ice water or cold compresses to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Contrary to popular belief, there are no populations of the brown recluse, Loxosceles reclusa, in California. In fact, fewer than 20 verified specimens have been collected in the state over several decades by spider experts. Yet people in California frequently relate stories in which they or someone they know was supposedly bitten or they have had a physician diagnose them with a brown recluse spider bite. Black widows on the other hand, are very common throughout the state, causing potentially serious injury with their bite. The adult females are easily identifiable by their shiny black body color and red hourglass on the belly. For information on black widows, see the Pest Notes: Widow Spiders and Their Relatives. Although the brown recluse does not live in California, four species of native recluse spiders occur in southern areas of the state and can cause similar medical concerns. The most common Californian recluse spider is the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta . It is found mostly in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, in the foothills of the lower San Joaquin Valley, and in adjacent areas of Mexico; most of these areas are sparsely populated by humans. This publication was written to provide science-based information about the status of the brown recluse and other related spiders in California. COMMON AND SCIENTIFIC NAMES Over the years, the group of spiders to which the brown recluse belongs has been known by various colloquial names: \"violin\" spiders, \"fiddleback\" spiders, \"recluse\" spiders, and \"brown\" spiders. The recluse spiders are in the family Sicariidae (formerly Loxoscelidae). The scientific name for the recluse spider genus is Loxosceles (lox-SOS-a-leez) and rhymes somewhat with \"isosceles\" as in the triangle. Whereas \"isosceles\" means equal legs, \"loxosceles\" means slanted legs, referring to the way the recluse spiders hold their legs at rest. All known members of the group have scientific names, and the more familiar members of this group also have common names (e.g., brown recluse, desert recluse, Arizona recluse).',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'The most definitive physical feature of recluse spiders is their eyes : most spiders have 8 eyes that typically are arranged in 2 rows of 4, but recluse spiders have 6 equal-sized eyes arranged in 3 pairs, each pair called dyads. There is a dyad at the front of the cephalothorax (the first main body part to which the legs attach) and another dyad on each side further back with a space separating the dyads from one another. Many publications refer to the \"violin\" marking on the dorsal (top) surface of the cephalothorax (head region) as the most important diagnostic feature. Although this marking is fairly consistent in mature brown recluses and Texan recluses (Loxosceles devia), it can vary in intensity, sometimes fading on preserved specimens, and it is very faint to nonexistent in several recluse species found in the southwestern United States (e.g., the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta). Therefore, checking the eye pattern is the best way to eliminate almost all suspect non-recluse spiders from consideration, whereas the presence or absence of the violin marking may lead to misidentifications. Non-arachnologists (including physicians, pest control operators, and even some entomologists) have envisioned \"violins\" on various body surfaces of harmless spiders and incorrectly assume that they have properly identified a brown recluse spider. In addition, the abdomens of all North American recluses are covered with fine hairs and are uniformly colored (not patterned), although the coloration can vary from light beige to dark brown, depending in part on what they have eaten recently. There is never a color pattern on the abdomen of North American specimens. Finally, the uniformly colored legs are similarly covered with fine hairs whereas many non-recluse spiders have stout spines and a pattern of stripes, rings, or spots on their legs. Some other spiders share one or more of these physical characteristics. However, to be identified as a recluse spider, it must have all 5 of these characteristics. six eyes in dyads (pairs) uniformly colored abdomen with fine hairs no spines on the legs uniformly colored legs body not more than 3/8\" in length On this basis, more than 99% of the spiders found by Californians can be identified as something other than a recluse spider. In the unlikely event that one does find a recluse spider in California, it will most likely be the native desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta. To identify Loxosceles spiders to species level requires a high-magnification microscope and the skills of a spider expert (arachnologist). SPIDERS COMMONLY CONFUSED WITH RECLUSES Because of the misinformation surrounding the brown recluse\\'s presence in California, many spiders that are virtually harmless are submitted by the public to arachnologists for identification. Most of them are not from the recluse family and some are not even spiders. A nationwide study was undertaken from 2000 to 2005, offering to identify any spider that was considered to be a brown recluse spider. Nearly 600 specimens were submitted from California, many from people who were adamant that they had a brown recluse. Only one of these specimens was a brown recluse, from a house where the family had moved from Missouri, a state that is well-known to have abundant brown recluse populations. No additional recluses were found in the house. The occasional finding of a translocated brown recluse spider is not surprising; however, it still is extremely rare. There were 17 desert recluse spiders submitted in this study, all from the desert regions of southeastern California where the spiders are known to occur. Non-recluse spiders were submitted in great numbers including many false black widows, woodlouse, and yellow sac spiders. Presented below are descriptions of spiders that share some of the same physical features as the brown recluse and have been misidentified as recluse spiders. For additional information on these spiders, consult a spider identification book such as Common Spiders of North America by Richard Bradley, listed in the References section or the table of common spider families found in California, located in the Pest Notes: Spiders . Six-Eyed Spiders Spitting spiders (Scytodes spp.) are closely related to recluse spiders and have 6 eyes arranged in a similar pattern. However, unlike recluse spiders, they also have many black spots or lines on their bodies and a strongly domed cephalothorax. The woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata, has 6 eyes arranged in 2 groups of 3 (triads) and no bodily markings. Spiders with Violin-Shaped or Other Dark Markings Many common tan or gray spiders have dark markings on the head region, which convinces people that they have caught a true recluse spider. These spiders include cellar spiders (Pholcus phalangioides, Psilochorus spp., Physocyclus spp.), pirate spiders (Mimetus spp.), and sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae family). The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, also confuses people even though the dark marks are on the ventral (underside) not the dorsal (top) surface of the body. The most common submissions as brown recluses are spiders in the genus Titiotus . These spiders are found just north of Los Angeles, through central California to Redding and are common in forests. Titiotus spiders have a hair pattern that gives the impression of a violin and its coloration is similar to that of a brown recluse. Another frequent submission is Zoropsis spinimana, which is found in the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento. It is a harmless Mediterranean immigrant species, first detected in California around 1995. It is large and frequently captured in homes. Residents see the dark marking on the top surface of the abdomen as a violin, but recluses have this type of marking on their cephalothorax. See the Pest Notes: Zoropsis spinimana, A Mediterranean Spider in California for more information. Ubiquitous Brown Spiders Virtually every spider that is tan or brown has been turned in by Californians as a potential brown recluse. There are hundreds of species of these spiders in California. They include ground spiders (Gnaphosidae), sac spiders (Cheiracanthium spp., Trachelas spp.), wolf spiders (Lycosidae), grass spiders (Agelenidae), orb weavers (Araneidae), and male crevice spiders (Filistatidae). Additionally, males of both the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the false black widow, Steatoda grossa, are frequently brought in as suspected recluse spiders. All of these brown spiders have 8 eyes and thus can be quickly eliminated from consideration. AMERICAN RECLUSE SPIDERS Eleven species of recluse spiders are native to the United States and two non-natives have become established in certain highly-limited areas of the country. The brown recluse spider is the proper common name for only one species, Loxosceles reclusa . It is the most widespread of the North American recluse spiders and lives in the south central Midwest from southeastern Nebraska to southwestern Ohio and south through Texas to north Georgia. In addition to these native species, the Chilean recluse spider, Loxosceles laeta (pronounced \"LEE-ta\"), has become established in portions of Los Angeles (Alhambra, Sierra Madre, Monterey Park, and San Gabriel). This spider, however, seems to be confined to a very limited area in Los Angeles County, has been present there for at least 80 years (one specimen was collected from Los Angeles in 1936) and is not spreading. Also, occasional interceptions of the Mediterranean recluse, Loxosceles rufescens are found in commercial goods shipped from out-of-state or from international cargo, but no populations of this spider are currently known in California and finds of them are still incredibly rare. Recluse spiders, as their name implies, are reclusive. They build webs as trigger systems to indicate that potential prey are walking nearby. They also use silk to build retreats in which to hide during the day. These nocturnal spiders emerge from their retreats at night and actively hunt down prey or may wait for prey to land in the small area several inches from their retreat. As dawn approaches, they may seek shelter in dark places such as in clothing or shoes, and mature males roam in search of females. It is these two behaviors that can bring them into contact with people. In nature, recluses are found in cracks and crevices in and under rocks or the loose bark of dead trees. Recluses have very much benefited from human-altered environments, where they are readily found under trash cans, plywood, tarps, rubber tires, and in storage boxes. They are synanthropic (found in association with humans) and therefore are considered \"house\" spiders. In fact in South America, the recluse species have common names that translate as \"the spider behind the picture\" or \"the spider in the corner.\" Recluse spiders are relatively long lived. Among the various species, they mature after about 1 year and average a 2- to 4-year life span with some living more than 7 years under laboratory conditions. They are also well known for surviving long periods (6 to 12 months) without food before perishing. Abundance of Recluses One consistent life history characteristic of recluse spiders is that in the right environment their populations are usually dense. If you find recluses, you do not find one, you find many. The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is a common house spider in the midwestern United States. Examples of the densities that the brown recluse can attain around human habitation include 9 under a piece of plywood in Oklahoma, 52 in an indoor laboratory, 6 under a waterbed frame in Arkansas, 40 collected in a Missouri barn in one hour, and 44 caught in sticky traps in a Tennessee home in one day. Eight Oklahoma 13-year-olds unknowingly hand-collected about 60 amongst bricks in about 7 minutes without getting bitten. In a 6-month study, a family in Kansas collected 2,055 brown recluse spiders in their 19th-century built home. They lived there nearly a decade, continued to find brown recluse spiders regularly, and only once in 10 years had anyone shown evidence of a bite; it was to a finger which turned red for a few days and then healed without incident. In fact, on many evenings, this family collected more brown recluse spiders per hour in their home than the entire California human population has ever been able to find in the state. Similarly, for the desert recluse in California, 12 of these spiders were collected under a doghouse in Yucca Valley and 6 were removed in one night from a small cottage bedroom in a Mojave Desert research facility. Absence of Brown Recluses in California Unlike many other spiders that disperse by either migrating or being carried by air currents when small (\"ballooning\"), recluse spiders usually only expand outside their native range as a result of human intervention. The few brown recluses that have been collected in California typically are found in facilities that receive goods from out of state or are unintentionally transported by people who have moved from the Midwest. In these instances, searching the immediate area yielded no additional brown recluses so they were considered to be individual stowaways. Undoubtedly, more brown recluses have been inadvertently brought into the state via commerce and the relocation of household belongings, especially during the Dust Bowl era, however amazingly few specimens have ever been collected. Translocated recluse spiders have never been able to establish a foothold and start a population in California. Considering that brown recluse spider bites are not common in the south-central Midwest where brown recluses frequently cohabit with people, it is clear that California does not have anywhere near sufficient populations of these spiders to be responsible for the number of bites that are attributed to them. RICE Therapy: The recommended treatment for most brown recluse bites (the ones that do not develop severe symptoms) is simple first aid: RICE therapy. R est I ce C ompression E levation',\n",
       "       'damage': 'All Loxosceles spiders tested so far have the venom component that is capable of causing necrotic skin lesions, so it is best to assume that all recluse spiders may be capable of causing skin damage. In general, the desert recluse spider\\'s venom is similar to that of the brown recluse and should be considered of equal potency. In comparison to the brown recluse spider, the Chilean recluse supposedly has more potent venom and the Mediterranean recluse\\'s venom has been said to be less potent. However, these comparisons are more anecdotal than quantitive assessments. About 10% of brown recluse bites cause moderate or greater tissue damage and scarring, but the vast majority only result in inflammation and heal well without medical intervention. Deaths have been reported in children, however these are extremely rare occurrences and can be prevented if accurately diagnosed and the proper medical treatment applied. Medical Misdiagnoses The problem of misdiagnosis is widespread in North America, including such unlikely places as Alaska and Canada where doctors have attributed skin lesions to recluse bites when no brown recluse spiders have ever been found north of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. One reason for the great awareness of the recluse spiders throughout North America is that necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds are commonly misdiagnosed as \"brown recluse bites.\" Although recluses can cause these types of wounds, the biological data involving the distribution of the spider indicate that most of these diagnoses are incorrect. A world-renowned toxicology physician who worked at University of Southern California Medical Center estimates that most general spider bites in California referred to him were actually the work of other arthropods, and that 60% of \"brown recluse spider bite\" diagnoses came from areas where no Loxosceles spiders were known to exist. This is a serious problem, in that several medical conditions misdiagnosed as recluse bites can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal consequences. Additionally, many people diagnosed as having brown recluse bites in California are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics work against bacteria and have no effect on spider venom. However, regardless of the causative agent, it is wise to seek medical attention if you feel that it is warranted. Because most brown recluse bites involve only inflammation, the recommended treatment is simple first aid: RICE therapy (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) although other medical experts suggest cold instead of ice (to avoid freezing tissue) and a neutral position (lay flat) rather than elevated. Multiple Lesions Spiders typically bite only once as a desperate defensive effort before they are crushed between flesh and some object. Therefore, spider bites are not the causes of skin lesions if 1) there are multiple lesions on one person at the same time, especially if the lesions are on widely separated parts of the body, 2) if there are multiple episodes of lesions on the same person over a period of several weeks or months, or 3) if there are multiple people in the same house or facility showing skin lesions at the same time. Multiple lesions immediately point toward the more likely situation of a contagious bacterial infection like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or possibly an infestation of an arthropod (fleas, mites, kissing bugs, bed bugs, etc.) that seeks out mammals for blood meals. Bacterial Infections Group A Streptococcus infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis, is sometimes misdiagnosed as a brown recluse bite, and has a fatality rate that can vary from 20 to 80% depending on how quickly it is correctly diagnosed. In serious cases, death from Strepococcus A can occur in a few days. Another medical condition that is frequently misdiagnosed as a spider bite or brown recluse bite is MRSA bacterial infection. Infections of this pathogen, which began to emerge in the 1990s, are no worse than other Staph infections. However, because they are not remedied by common antibiotics, the infections continue out of control and can be fatal unless properly medicated. In one national study involving 11 university-based medical facilities, 29% of the patients presenting for \"spider bite\" had MRSA as the cause of their skin and soft tissue injury. MRSA is a contagious infection, frequently found in places where people are housed in close quarters for lengthy periods of time. Such conditions include prisons and other correctional facilities, nursing homes, long-term health care facilities, sports camps, military barracks, and locker rooms and typically involve several people being afflicted simultaneously. Very often \"spider bites\" are the first thing that people blame as the cause of these wounds. However, more careful investigation typically leads to identifying a MRSA bacterial infection as the causal agent.The problem clears up quickly when the bacterial infection is correctly diagnosed and treated. Necrotic Wound Causes If you do get a necrotic wound in California, you and your medical professional should consider many other common causes to be much more probable than a bite from a brown recluse spider. If an arthropod is involved at all, one should first consider all those creatures that seek out mammals for blood meals and may cause necrotic-type wounds. These include mites, fleas, bed bugs, mosquitoes, soft ticks, hard ticks, and blood-sucking conenose bugs (also known as kissing bugs) (see Pest Notes : Fleas, Bed Bugs, Mosquitoes, Conenose Bugs, and Lyme Disease in California listed in SUGGESTED READING). In addition, there is a long list of medical conditions and diseases that exhibit necrotic-type wounds. A few of these are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial infections, lymphomatoid papulosis (a non-Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphoma), diabetic ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, infected herpes simplex, herpes zoster (\"shingles\"), chemical and thermal burns, poison ivy, poison oak, and Lyme disease. Any and all of these situations are more likely than the bite of a brown recluse spider in California.',\n",
       "       'management': 'If you do not live in the shaded areas on the map, you do not need to be concerned with recluse spiders in California. If you do live within the range of these spiders, you still need to verify that you have recluses on your property before attempting control. Not all micro-habitats within the shaded areas will be suitable for recluse survival. For example, even though Loxosceles laeta occurs in densely populated sections of Los Angeles, this species is usually found only in dark commercial and municipal storage basements, not in homes. This leaves the desert recluse as the only California species of concern, and a minor one at that. After verifying that you do have desert recluses in your home, there are steps you can take to reduce encounters with them. These measures are similar for reducing encounters with spiders in general. Nonchemical control The most important precaution is to remove or reduce outdoor trash and rubbish, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cansespecially if they are stored right next to the house. In residences with attached garages, block off house access to spiders by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites in self defense. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any bed skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under the bed. This minimizes the chance that any spider can crawl onto the bed and inflict a bite. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally used (gardening clothes and gloves, boots, baseball mitts, seasonal clothes and gear, etc.) should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags or bins, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Sticky traps placed along floor boards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. See the short UC IPM YouTube video How to Catch a Spider. Chemical control Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy and much less toxic for your living area to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify. Freeze the spider first, soak it in rubbing alcohol for a few days to preserve it, then pour off the alcohol and rinse the spider with water to remove alcohol residue before shipping. When sending the spider in for identification, do not mail it in alcohol as this is a violation of postal regulations.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Protect spiders in your garden because they prey on insects and other pests. Most spiders observed in the open during the day are not likely to bite you or cause lasting harm if they do bite you. Spiders whose bites might require you to seek medical attention spend most of their time hidden. Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have 8 legs and 2 body partsan abdomen and a combined head and thorax. They lack wings and antennae. Spider families vary by body shape, web type, hunting or other behavior, and the arrangement and relative size of their eyes. Cellar spiders have long, skinny legs and hang upside down in dark corners, often indoors, sometimes bouncing when disturbed. The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, is shown here. Cobweb spiders hang upside down in sticky, irregularly spun webs waiting for prey. Most cobweb species are small and harmless, such as this Theridion dilutum. Western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most well-known cobweb spider. Most black widow bites come from mature adult females (left), which can usually be recognized by a red hourglass on the underside of the abdomen. The adult male (right) is lighter-colored and smaller than the female. Crab or flower spiders, such as Misumena vatia, have enlarged front legs. They hunt during the day without webs. Dwarf spiders are tiny, hunt during the day, and produce sheetlike or irregular crisscross webs on surfaces. Funnel weavers spin thick, flattened webs and sit at the center of a silken hole, or funnel, running out to capture prey that contact the web. Often seen are Hololena nedra (left) and the common house spider, Tegenaria species, (right) found in gardens and on walls and ceilings inside the house. Lynx spiders are active hunters that stalk and capture prey. Legs are spiny, and the abdomen is narrowest at the rear. They dont spin webs. Shown here is a green lynx spider, Peucetia viridans . Jumping spiders hunt during the day, stalking and pouncing on prey. They are hairy, sometimes iridescent, and dont spin webs. This Phidippus species is eating a house fly. Orb weaver or garden spiders, such as this western spotted orb weaver, Neoscona oaxacensis, (left) often are large and colorful and wait in their webs or nearby for prey to become entangled. They spin elaborate webs in concentric circles in the garden. Sac spiders hide in silk tubes in places such as corners, beneath plants, or on bark, and stalk prey at night. They occur indoors and out and usually are pale, such as this agrarian sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum. Wolf spiders have long, hairy legs and are often found running along the ground. They dont build webs to capture prey but can have a silken retreat. Females carry young on their backs.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Roses are among the most intensively managed plants in many home gardens, parks, and other landscapes. For some gardeners, this intensive management may include the application of pesticides to manage insects and mites. Other enthusiasts can maintain vigorous plants and produce high quality blooms with little or no use of insecticides. The keys to avoiding pest problems are careful selection of varieties (which vary significantly in susceptibility to insect and disease problems), good attention to appropriate cultural practices, and occasional handpicking or water sprays to remove pests. Regularly monitor for pests and keep an eye out for rising populations of the natural enemies that often rapidly reduce the numbers of aphids, mites, and other pests. For management of diseases see Pest Notes: Roses: Diseases and Abiotic Disorders, and for general tips on cultural practices and weed control, see Pest Notes: Roses: Cultural Practices and Weed Control.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': \"Aphids. Aphids are the most common insect pests on roses. Species include the rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae, the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, and the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, among others. Aphids favor rapidly growing tissue such as buds and shoots. Low to moderate levels of aphids do little damage to plants, although some gardeners may be concerned by their very presence. Moderate to high populations can secrete copious amounts of honeydew, resulting in the growth of sooty mold, which blackens leaves. Very high numbers of aphids may distort or kill buds or reduce flower size. In most areas of California aphids are only considered a major problem for about 6 weeks in spring and early summer before high summer temperatures reduce their numbers. Aphids have many natural enemies including parasitic wasps, lady beetles, soldier beetles, and syrphid flies (see the section on Common Natural Enemies) that may rapidly reduce increasing populations. Ants protect aphids from natural enemies, so keeping them out of bushes with sticky barriers, baits, or traps may improve biological control. Lady beetles often increase in number when aphid populations are high. The convergent lady beetle is sold at nurseries for release against aphids and may provide limited control when properly released. For more information on how to release them see UC IPMs convergent lady beetle page in the Natural Enemies Gallery. Releasing green lacewings against the rose aphid has not been shown to offer significant control in research trials. A naturally occurring fungal disease may control aphids when conditions are wet or humid. In many landscape situations, knocking aphids off with a forceful stream or spray of water early in the day is all that is needed to supplement natural control. Insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils (including neem oil) can also be used to suppress aphids with only moderate impact on natural enemies. Soil-applied systemic insecticides, such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, are effective but are not usually necessary and may harm pollinators and natural enemies. Use of broadly toxic insecticides is not warranted in most gardens and landscapes. For more information on aphids see Pest Notes: Aphids . Insects and Mites that Cause Leaves to Stipple or Yellow Spider mites, including twospotted spider mite, Pacific spider mite, and strawberry spider mite, all in the genus Tetranychus, feed on foliage, causing leaves to become stippled or bleached, and may cause leaves to dry up and fall. Some species produce webbing while others do not. Spider mites are tiny (about the size of the period at the end of this sentence) and are best seen with a magnifier. Mites usually appear first on the undersides of leaves but may move to the upper surfaces as populations increase. High numbers are usually associated with dry, dusty conditions. Spider mite numbers may greatly increase if their many natural enemies are killed by broad-spectrum insecticides applied against other pests. For instance, applications of carbaryl or pyrethroid insecticides (such as cyfluthrin and permethrin) to control insect pests are frequently followed by an increase in mite populations. Conserving natural enemies, providing sufficient irrigation, and reducing dust may all help control mites. Overhead irrigation or periodic washing of leaves with water can be very effective in reducing mite numbers. If chemical treatment is necessary, spider mites can be controlled with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, and sprays should be targeted to ensure coverage of the undersides of the leaves. Although spider mites may be listed on many insecticide labels, most insecticides are not very effective against them and can actually trigger mite flare-ups as mentioned above. For more information about spider mites, see Pest Notes: Spider Mites . Rose leafhopper, Edwardsiana rosae, causes stippling damage that appears larger than mite stippling. Along with stippling, cast skins and the absence of webbing on the underside of leaves are good indications that leafhoppers are present. Leafhoppers are not common problems in most areas; be sure to check for the insects themselves if suspect stippling is observed. Plants can tolerate moderate stippling. Knock leafhoppers off with a water spray or use an insecticidal soap on nymphs if an infestation is severe. Insects that Distort or Discolor Blossoms Thrips. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, and madrone thrips, Thrips madroni, primarily cause injury to rose flowers, causing blossom petals to streak with brown or become distorted. Damage may be severe if flowers are attacked early at the bud stage. The tiny yellow or black thrips insects can be found within the blossoms. In August 2015, a new species of thrips, the chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis, was found infesting roses in southern California. This species, which is native to Asia and about the size of western flower thrips, can severely distort plant growth. This species may be found on leaves, leaf litter, on the axils of leaves, in curled leaves, and under the calyxes of flowers. Chilli thrips has a broad host range and, because of its habit of attacking leaves as well as flowers, has the potential to cause much more serious damage than other thrips species. Thrips problems are more likely to be severe where many rose plants grown close together provide a continuously blooming habitat. Fragrant, light-colored, and white roses are most often attacked and can be severely damaged. Cultivars with sepals that remain tightly wrapped around the bud until blooms open have fewer thrips problems. In most home garden and landscape situations, thrips can be tolerated. Frequent clipping and prompt disposal of spent blooms may reduce thrips problems. Control with insecticides is difficult because products are most effective on developing thrips, which usually feed deep within buds or flowers where pesticide applications cannot reach. It should be noted that western flower thrips can sometimes be considered beneficial because they are predators of spider mites. Insects that Chew Blossoms and/or Leaves Fuller rose beetle. Adults of Fuller rose beetle, Naupactus godmani, chew flowers and foliage leaving notched or ragged edges. Adult beetles are pale brown weevils that are about 3/8 inch long. They are flightless and hide during the day, often on the undersides of leaves. Feeding takes place at night. The larvae are root feeders but do not seriously damage roses. Low numbers can be ignored. Otherwise, handpick the beetles off plants, use sticky material on stems to trap and exclude them, and trim any branches touching walls, fences, or other plants. In California, adults emerge from June to November and are difficult to control with insecticides. Parasitic nematodes, which attack larvae, may be helpful if applied to the soil in early to midsummer. Hoplia beetle, Hoplia callipyge, is about 1/4 inch long and chews holes mostly in the petals of open flowers. It is primarily a problem in the Central Valley from Sacramento south to Bakersfield. The hoplia beetle prefers feeding on flowers of light-colored roses (white, pink, apricot, and yellow) and does not damage leaves. Larvae are root feeders but do not feed on the roots of rose plants. There is only one generation a year and damage is usually confined to the 2- to 4-week period in late spring when adults are active. Adult hoplia beetles can be handpicked or infested rose blooms removed. Insecticide sprays are not very effective and should not be necessary in a garden situation. For more information about hoplia beetle, see Pest Notes: Hoplia Beetle . Hoplia beetles may be mistaken for Japanese beetles, Popillia japonica, serious pests in other areas of the United States, but Japanese beetles are about twice as long and are metallic green with coppery wing covers. Japanese beetles are not established in California. If you believe you have found a Japanese beetle in your landscape, contact the California Department of Food and Agriculture Hotline (1-800-491-1899; also see cdfa.ca.gov/plant/JB/). Leafcutting bees, Megachile spp., cut semicircular holes in the margins of leaves and carry leaf material back to use in lining their nests. Bees are important pollinators and should not be killed. There are no effective controls. Rose curculio, Merhynchites bicolor ., is a reddish-black snout weevil about 1/4 inch long that prefers yellow and white roses. Adults feed by drilling holes in flower buds that may kill the developing bud or result in ragged holes in blossoms when they open. If weevils are numerous, terminal shoots may be killed as well. Eggs are laid inside buds and larvae feed within, often killing buds before they open. When mature, larvae drop to the ground to overwinter and pupate in the soil, emerging as adults in spring. There is only one generation a year. Hand pick adults off plants and destroy buds infested with larvae. Many beetles may be removed from heavily infested bushes by gently shaking plants over a bucket of soapy water. A broad-spectrum insecticide can be applied to kill adults if the infestation is severe. Caterpillars such as orange tortrix, tussock moth, fruittree leafroller, tent caterpillar, and omnivorous looper may feed on rose leaves, flowers and buds . Some of these caterpillars may also tie leaves together with silk. Some caterpillars, like the tobacco budworm, may bore into flower buds. Look for the caterpillar or its frass inside. Hand pick caterpillars or prune out and promptly dispose of infested buds or rolled leaves (often hiding caterpillars within). Damage is usually not severe and treatment with pesticides not generally necessary. Leaf-feeding caterpillars can be reduced with the microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis or the insecticide spinosad. These materials will be most effective when caterpillars are small, and caterpillars within buds are unlikely to be killed. Damage may not be noticed until after caterpillars are full grown and no longer vulnerable to insecticide applications. Roseslugs include several species of sawflies that damage leaves on roses. Sawflies are wasps with plant-feeding larvae that resemble caterpillars. Young larvae skeletonize lower leaf surfaces while mature larvae chew large holes in leaves. Roseslugs have many natural enemies that help keep their populations down. They may be washed off plants with strong streams of water or killed with insecticidal soap, horticultural oil, or spinosad. Insecticides containing Bacillus thuringiensis are not effective against roseslugs because they are not the larvae of butterflies or moths. Insects that Cause Canes to Die Back Flatheaded borers, Chrysobothris spp., may kill canes or entire plants. Larvae are white and up to 1 inch long with enlarged heads. Adult beetles do not significantly damage roses. Eggs tend to be laid on stressed rose plants, especially in bark wounds caused by sunburn or disease. Remove and destroy infested plant material and keep plants healthy by providing sufficient irrigation and avoiding excessive summer pruning. Raspberry horntail larvae, Hartigia cressoni, are white, segmented larvae up to 1 inch long that feed within rose stems or canes. Adults are black or black and yellow wood wasps about 1/2 inch long. In the spring, horntail feeding can cause tips of canes to wilt and die, reducing second-cycle rose blooms. Inspect canes in spring (mid-April to mid-June) for egg-laying incisions or swellings caused by larvae feeding within and cut them off below the infestation. Prune down infested canes until a healthy cross section is found. Scale insects that may attack roses include two species of armored scales: the rose scale, Aulacaspis rosae, and the San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus . These pests may cause cane decline or dieback when numbers are high. San Jose scale may spread by wind from nearby orchards, and so may be found on roses near urban-agricultural interfaces in California's Central Valley and other fruit or nut tree production areas. Armored scales can be observed on canes as small, grayish, round to oval encrustations, ranging in size from 1/8 to 1/4 inch. These insects have no legs or antennae for most of their lives and are immobile. In winter, cut back and destroy infested canes and apply insecticidal oil to any remaining infested canes if the scale population is high. Scales are attacked by many natural enemies. Look for exit holes in mature scale covers, indicating parasitization. Other scale insects, including cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi, and several species of soft scales such as black scale, Saissetia oleae, may also be found on roses. These insects produce honeydew, which may cause leaves to be sticky and will allow black sooty mold to colonize leaf surfaces. Washing plants with soap and water may reduce populations. Pruning and application of horticultural oil in winter for armored scales should provide sufficient control. For more information about scale insects, see Pest Notes: Scales . Insects Seldom Found in California Roses Mossy rose galls, created by the gall wasp Diplolepis rosae, are spherical spined masses of plant tissue about an inch in diameter that form on year-old rose twigs. At first, the deformity resembles moss, but it becomes hardened as it enlarges. Although mossy rose gall is most common, many kinds of galls can form on roses; most caused by different gall wasp species. They may occur on twigs, stems or leaves and have various shapes and textures. Galls are more common in cooler, northern parts of California than in the Central Valley. They are generally not damaging and pruning them out should provide sufficient control. Rose midge, Dasineura rhodophaga, was found infesting roses in a nursery in Petaluma, California, in August 1996; however, it has not been reported in California since. This pest can cause severe damage and is established in Oregon, Washington, and other states, so rose growers should be on the lookout for new infestations, especially when purchasing new plants. Rose midges are tiny flies that lay their eggs inside the sepals of flower buds or on plant terminals. Hatching larvae move into flower buds to feed, leaving the injured buds to wither, blacken, and die. Pupation occurs in the soil and 2 to 4 generations can occur annually. Take any suspected infested material to your county Agricultural Commissioner for identification. Don't confuse the rose midge with the similar looking beneficial midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza, which feeds on aphids. Aphidoletes larvae are found on stem, bud, or leaf surfaces feeding within aphid colonies, whereas Dasineura larvae will be hidden out of view at the bases of developing buds. COMMON NATURAL ENEMIES Aphid parasites. Tiny parasitic wasps are very important in the control of aphids on roses. Adults lay their eggs within the aphid and developing wasp larvae feeding within rapidly immobilize the aphids. Eventually, the parasites kill the aphids and turn them into bronze or black crusty, bloated mummies. The parasitic wasp larva pupates within the mummy and then cuts a neat, round hole and emerges as a full-grown wasp . Once you see one mummy in the aphid colony, you are likely to see more. Parasitic wasps are also important in the control of scale insects, caterpillars, and many other insect pests. Minute pirate bug. Minute pirate bugs, Orius tristicolor, are tiny true bugs with black and white markings as adults. They are often among the first predators to appear in spring, and they feed on mites, insect and mite eggs, immature scales, and thrips. Lacewings. Green lacewings in the genera Chrysopa and Chrysoperla are common natural enemies of aphids and other soft-bodied insects. The gray-green to brown alligator-shaped larvae are the predatory stage. The green lacy-winged adults feed on honeydew. Lady beetles. Many different red and black lady beetle species are predators of aphids; the most common is the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens . Another common species in the garden is the Asian multicolored lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis . These lady beetles feed primarily on aphids and are predators in both the adult and larval stages. Look for the black, alligator-shaped larvae with orange dots and oblong, yellow lady beetle eggs that are laid on end in groups. Releases of commercially available convergent lady beetles can reduce aphid numbers. However, large numbers must be released on each individual rose plant. Mist lady beetles with a water spray before release. Make releases in the evening at dusk by placing beetles on canes at the base of plants. Wet plants first with a fine spray of water. Expect 90% of the lady beetles to fly away in the first 24 hours. The remaining lady beetles are unlikely to lay eggs and will fly away once aphid populations have been substantially reduced. Leatherwings or soldier beetles . These moderate to large-sized beetles in the cantharid family have leatherlike dark wings and orange or red heads and thoraxes. Several species feed on aphids and are very common on roses. Many people mistake soldier beetles for pests, but they can be important predators. Sometimes the beetles, which may feed on pollen and nectar as well as aphids, leave dark splotches of excrement on leaves. Soldier beetle larvae are also predaceous but live in the soil, feeding on soil-dwelling invertebrates. Syrphid flies. In their larval stage, syrphids, sometimes called flower flies or hover flies, are important predators of aphids and are very common on roses. Syrphid adults superficially resemble honey bees or wasps, feed on nectar and pollen before reproducing, and are often seen hovering above flowers. There are many species of hover flies in California. The aphid-feeding larvae, often found within aphid colonies, are legless and maggot-shaped and vary in color from dull brown or yellow to bright green; some species have a stripe down their backs. Don't mistake them for moth or butterfly caterpillars, which have legs and chew holes in leaves. Predaceous mites. A number of predatory mites feed on spider mites, often keeping them at tolerable levels. Predatory mites can be distinguished from the plant-feeding spider mites by the absence of the two spots on either side of the body, their pear shape, and their more active habits. Compared to the plant-feeding species of mites, which remain in one location feeding, predatory mites move rapidly around the leaf when looking for prey. Because they are so small, a hand lens is helpful in viewing them. Thrips . Sixspotted thrips, Eotetranychus sexmaculatus, feeds on spider mites. Western flower thrips are plant feeders but also feed on spider mites. While thrips damage may not be tolerated within commercial production, in landscape settings thrips may provide benefits outweighing the limited damage they cause. Spiders. All spiders are predators and many contribute significantly to biological control. Many types of spiders including crab spiders, jumping spiders, cobweb spiders, and orbweavers occur in landscapes.\",\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'There are two species of widow spiders in California, the western black widow and the brown widow. Both are in the genus Latrodectus and are characterized by a similar body shape, reclusive habit, and irregular cobwebs. The western black widow, a native species, is widespread, and is the spider posing the greatest potential envenomation threat to humans in the western United States. It is well known in many localities, and nonprofessionals can identify it easily. In the first decade of the 21st century, the non-native brown widow became established in southern California. Although it isn\\'t nearly as dangerous as the black widow, it causes alarm because of the reputation of its relative. BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS Several species of black widow are common in North America, but in the western United States the only species present is the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus. Its habitat ranges from British Columbia and Alberta to Mexico and throughout the Rocky Mountains to the western portions of the Great Plains. In California, it is a common desert spider that can survive very hot, dry conditions. However, black widows also can be found in mountainous terrain above 5,000-foot elevation in Southern California, where snow covers the ground every winter. Outside California, western black widows are common in urban Colorado, in central and eastern Washington state, and in southern British Columbia. Because the holes, cracks, crevices, trash, and clutter associated with human structures provide ideal habitat for the western black widow, these spiders are often very common around homes, barns, outbuildings, and rock walls. In such supportive habitats, mature females can be found every few feet and sometimes within inches of each other. Identification A mature female western black widow spider is about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in body length, and has a rounded abdomen and very characteristic coloration. She is shiny jet black all over her body and legs, except for a red pattern on the underside of the abdomen, which looks, in perfect specimens, like an hourglass. Some specimens have a brownish or plum-colored tinge, but usually these are females that are so well fed that the black-pigmented abdomen has been stretched until it looks brown instead of black. The red hourglass varies in appearance; it can be two perfect triangles with points merged to make a perfect hourglass, two triangles separated by a space, a triangle and a small bar, minimal or almost imperceptible red coloration, or, on rare occasions, completely absent. The false black widow, which is discussed below, is chocolate brown and never has red coloration, although many people frequently mistake it for a black widow. As easy as it is to identify an adult female black widow, the immatures, looking nothing like the mother, can be difficult to recognize. When black widow spiderlings emerge from their egg sac, they have tan legs and a tan cephalothorax (the body part to which the legs attach), while the abdomen is mostly white with a few black spots. As the spider grows, the background coloration of the abdomen becomes olive-gray or tan; and there is a longitudinal white stripe on the top of the abdomen and diagonal stripes on the flanks, with a small black dot at the uppermost portion of each diagonal stripe. As the spiderlings continue to grow larger, they molt, like all spiders, in order to shed their restrictive exoskeletons. With successive molts in females, the white stripes become thinner, the olive-gray or tan coloration darkens toward black, and eventually the spider acquires its well-known black coloration. Some mature females retain one or two conspicuous, indented white lines on the front surface of the abdomen that look like a corporal\\'s chevrons. In the youngest spiders, the space where the hourglass develops starts off being a whitish shield. As the spider grows and molts several times, the color of this shield turns from white-yellow to orange-red and changes from a shield with a thick middle portion to an hourglass with a thin, tapered middle. In contrast to the female, the male black widow retains the coloration of the juvenile. After it matures, it stops eating and its abdomen shrinks (its only task at this point is to mate). The male still retains one longitudinal abdominal stripe and a set of diagonal flank stripes on each side of the abdomen. The males are much smaller than the females in body length, although sometimes their legs are almost as long as those of the adult female. Egg Sac The egg sac of the western black widow is yellowish and teardrop-shaped, tapered at the top and bulbous at the bottom. The margins of the sac are well defined (as opposed to some spider egg sacs, which look like fluffy cotton balls, making it difficult to determine exactly where the egg sac starts). The egg sac covering is very tough and difficult to rip apart. A female western black widow typically lays about 300 eggs per sac. Because females can store sperm from their only mating, they can produce more than 10 egg sacs without subsequent matings and without a decrease in the number of eggs or a reduction in the percentage of eggs that will successfully hatch into spiderlings. Habitat The western black widow is found in populated areas almost everywhere in California. Although they can be found in homes, black widows typically nest outside, around the home in holes and crevices, and within clutter. In garages, they usually make webs by doors, near vents, and in other places where insects may pass by. Because most people don\\'t tolerate large numbers of insects in their living spaces, widow spiders usually won\\'t find sufficient prey to survive inside homes. Black widows are shy spiders that seek retreats, such as holes between bricks or spaces around pipe penetrations in walls, where they can hide during the day and then come out at night. In natural settings, you can often find them in rodent burrows and crevices in rock faces. The spider makes a web of tangled silk extending from this retreat hole. The web doesn\\'t have a very recognizable pattern, although it does have vertical support threads above and below the central areas where the spider sits while it waits for prey at night. The lower support threads also alert the widow to the presence of a prey item blundering into the web. In most cases, a widow spider will seek a retreat near the ground as the home base for her web, which connects to the retreat, allowing the spider to emerge to catch both flying and crawling prey at night, usually within three feet of the ground. However, some spiders will make a retreat well above ground level, such as in the eave of a house, and then drop down 10 or more feet before building their web. Widow spiders come out at dusk. After making improvements to their existing web, they take up a position in the middle, their underside facing upward, to wait for prey. Any large disturbance of the web that indicates something larger than a prey item causes the spider to quickly move toward the safety of its retreat. The silk of a mature black widow is very strong. If you run your finger through the web of a large spider, the result is an audible ripping sound. Black widow silk is so strong that during World War II, it was used to make crosshairs for gun sights. Medical Aspects Bites from black widow spiders are quite rare, even where these spiders are very common. In the unlikely event of an actual bite from a black widow, the bite itself is painless or may feel like a little pinprick. Almost all medically important black widow bites are from the adult female, which is much larger than the male. The female also has stronger biting muscles and a larger venom reserve. At the site of the bite, there may be a little red mark or red streaking away from the bite. Within an hour, other symptoms may start to appear. Bite victims might suffer from some but not all of the following symptoms: Rigid stomach muscles, which some medical professionals have misdiagnosed as appendicitis Sweating, sometimes of just the bitten body part, such as a bite to the hand that results in only the arm sweating profusely Pain that can be local, radiating, or regional Urine retention Numbness, agitation, fever, and patchy paralysis (less common) Another sign of envenomation is that bite victims will sometimes move or rock back and forth incessantly to try to lessen the pain from the venom injection process. Although these are the most severe manifestations of black widow bites, symptoms most often merely resemble those of the flu. Black widow bites don\\'t cause conspicuous swelling, necrosis, or deterioration of tissue around the bite. As a neurotoxin, the venom of a black widow affects the nerve-muscle junction in the body. Normally, the body\\'s neurons work like a light switch: they make the muscle turn on and then off again so that the muscle can relax and be ready to contract again if needed. The venom causes the muscle to repeatedly contract. It would be like flipping on a light switch and not being able to turn it off again. If bitten, seek medical attention immediately. You can place a cold pack on the bite to relieve the pain. An antivenom for black widow bites is available that works for all species that have been tested worldwide. Response is fast, and bite victims can go from intense pain back to normal in 30 minutes. The antivenom is based on horse serum, so physicians need to monitor for anaphylactic shock. American physicians are somewhat reluctant to use antivenom for this reason and might prefer to have the bite victim simply endure the symptoms, which can be similar to those of a bad flu episode and usually dissipate in a few days. BROWN WIDOW SPIDERS The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is found worldwide in subtropical habitats. It probably originated from Africa, or possibly from South America. In North America, the brown widow was found only in Florida for many decades, where it remains rather common. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the spider began appearing elsewhere, from Texas throughout the Gulf Coast states and up the Atlantic coast into South Carolina. While they were expanding in the southeastern United States, brown widows started being discovered in great numbers in Southern California, where they have caused great concern within the general public. Initial news reports exaggerated the impact of the brown widow. However, unlike that of the black widow, the bite of this spider is not much more toxic to humans than that of other common spiders. Identification Mature female brown widows are smaller than mature female western black widows, being about 3/8\" in body length (10 mm). The normal brown widow spider coloration is a mottled collection of tan, brown, and gray. It has a lengthwise stripe halfway up the back side of the abdomen with two isolated dots in front of it and diagonal stripes on the side, somewhat similar to immature western black widow spiders (see Table 1). However, the usual background coloration of the brown widow is more of a tan, as compared to the western black widow, in which background coloration is more olive-gray. Male brown widows are much smaller [body length: 3/16 inch (4 to 5 mm)] than other widow spiders and therefore might be overlooked or misidentified. There is, however, great variation in brown widow coloration. Spiders can vary from almost white to almost black. When brown widows are very dark, though, this coloration is closer to a flat black than a shiny black like that of a mature black widow female. A mature brown widow female looks very similar to an immature western black widow, thus some skill is needed to identify the two accurately. However, the brown widow egg sac, as described in the next paragraph, is distinctive and a much surer way to confirm the species. Table 1. Features used to distinguish brown widows from immature western black widows. Feature Brown widow Black widow (immature) Black spots on lateral abdominal stripes large, squarish small, elliptical Hourglass bottom half larger top half larger rough margins crisp, straight margins White markings on front of abdomen not continuous continuous Egg Sac The egg sac of the brown widow spider has protuberances of silk all over its surface, resembling a very large pollen grain. The sac is so characteristic that it can be used to verify the presence of brown widows even if the spiders themselves are not seen. Brown widows produce about 130 eggs per egg sac and are able to make 20 or more egg sacs in a lifetime, sometimes multiple sacs within a short time period. Female brown widows can be collected with several simultaneously-developing egg sacs. Habitat The habitat of the brown widow is similar in many respects to that of the black widow. They generally reside in cluttered areas outside, such as woodpiles, but you will also find them in more exposed areas, such as on chain-link fences where black widows normally would not be found. They are also extremely common in the nooks and crannies on the undersides of inexpensive plastic patio furniture. Brown widow spiders make irregular webs of strong silk, similar to those of western black widows. Both black widows and brown widows are almost never found in homes. In garages, black widows are common but brown widows are not. Outside and around the home, both spiders are very common. The brown widow appears to be displacing the black widow in some of its habitats, especially in urban areas. Southern California residents frequently mention that they used to have a few black widows, but now only can find brown widows (and in greater numbers). In a study published in 2012, brown widows outnumbered black widows in urban areas; such as around homes, in parks (especially under playground equipment), in zoos, etc. The same study, however, reported that brown widows were not found in natural areas in southern California (such as in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat) and were rare around agricultural buildings. Brown widows were occasionally found in agricultural crops such as citrus, apple, and avocado trees as well as in corn stalks, bird-of-paradise leaves and other plants, but most of these finds were in vegetation associated with small home gardens rather than large commercial properties. As of 2016, brown widows were well established from Santa Barbara to the San Bernardino area and south to Mexico. Established populations have not yet been found north of the Los Angeles Basin, in the Central Valley, or in the desert areas (which may be inhospitable for them due to the arid climate). Although unsubstantiated reports of brown widows occurring north of the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara region (such as in the San Francisco Bay area) have been made for years, submitted spiders have been immature black widows, Steatoda (false black widow) spiders of several species, or orbweavers. However, it is possible that the brown widow is continuing to expand its range in California. Medical Aspects The bite of the brown widow is much milder than that of the western black widow. In a study in Africa, the most common symptoms in 15 verified bites were that the bite hurt when it happened and that there was burning pain at the bite site. None of these patients developed the typical dynamic symptoms of black widow envenomation. Despite these observations, there is one American record of a verified bite where the patient developed more severe symptoms and required hospitalization. Although its venom is at least as potent as black widow venom (drop for drop, as tested in mice), the brown widow is smaller and likely injects much less venom during a bite. In addition, bites to people are unlikely since brown widows, when disturbed, typically pull their legs close to the body, drop from their web, and play dead. The recent arrival of the brown widow in Southern California is not a cause for alarm. In fact, if the brown widow is indeed displacing the more toxic black widow, there actually might be a reduction in spider bite risk as compared to previous decades. OTHER RELATED SPIDERS False Black Widow The false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, is not a true widow spider; however, it is in the same family, Theridiidae, as widow spiders and can easily be confused with them. It shares the same rounded-abdomen body form and web-making traits. It is slightly smaller than a mature western black widow spider [body length: 3/8 inch (10 mm)], chocolate brown in color, and never has red coloration on its belly. The false black widow is a European immigrant that has become extremely common in Pacific Coast homes from San Diego to British Columbia, with isolated finds in Alaska. Unlike black widows, false black widow spiders thrive indoors, especially in washrooms, inside cupboards and underneath appliances, furniture and cabinets. False black widows make an egg sac that looks like a cotton ball with indistinct margins. Unlike black widow spiders, false black widow spiderlings are dark like their mothers when they emerge. Because they are common in homes, false black widows are more frequently involved in bite incidents than black widow or brown widow spiders. They have mild venom, and bites may cause symptoms similar to those of yellowjacket wasp stings: initial burning pain followed by minor localized swelling around the envenomation site. When black widow antivenom mistakenly has been used on false black widow bites, it appeared to eliminate the venom\\'s effects. Noble False Widow Spider In 2011, Steatoda nobilis was discovered in Southern California. Like the false black widow, this spider is a European native. Mature females can reach 5/8 inch (14 mm) in body length, which is significantly larger than the false black widow. Instead of being uniformly colored on the top surface of the abdomen as is the false black widow, Steatoda nobilis usually has a light tan pattern somewhat resembling a house with two windows and a domed roof. However, in some specimens, only the remnant tip of the \"roof\" is exhibited. There is also a broad, tan band on the front-facing surface of the abdomen. This spider was first found in Ventura County. It is now widespread in coastal San Diego County, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay area. Isolated finds have occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Bites from this species are not considered to be medically significant. There have been two recorded bites from the spider, with minor symptom development, but because of its large size, it has the potential to hurt merely from fang penetration. This spider will probably continue to spread throughout coastal California.',\n",

       "       'management': \"Minimizing sites around the home where spiders may hide, such as clutter, woodpiles, and heavy ground cover, is essential for reducing widow spider populations. However, it is not practical to eliminate these spiders completely. Both widow species will continue to re-infest treated areas. Regularly vacuuming or sweeping windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, and other seldom-used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually don't survive this process. In the garage, keep items such as gardening clothes and gloves in bags closed with zipper-locks or twist ties. Store seasonal items such as sports gear, camping gear, winter clothes or holiday decorations in boxes that can be taped shut and placed off the floor away from walls in order to exclude spiders. When cleaning up clutter in garages and other storage areas, be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Other areas to check carefully include children's toys or playhouses made of molded plastic that have open spaces facing downward where spiders can crawl in. Additional favored habitats of widow spiders include picnic tables, trash can grips, lawn chairs, plant pots with curled lips, and other outdoor objects with sheltered lips or crevices. Be careful that you do not carry spiders indoors on items such as plants, firewood, and boxes. Stack woodpiles away from your house, and never pick up pieces of wood unless you are wearing gloves. Eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping areas near building foundations free of trash, leaf litter, and accumulations of other materials. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attract spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures pointed off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides do not provide long-term control. Because widow spiders are nocturnal, a nonchemical method of eradication is to search for them at night with a flashlight and kill them with a shoe or rolled up newspaper. If you are concerned about wildlife and feel comfortable doing so, you can remove individual spiders from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper underneath to seal off the opening when you lift the jar. Release the spider about 100 feet from your home into a natural area. Brown widows may not survive in natural areas but on the other hand, they are an invasive, non-native pest species and should not be there anyway. One aspect that makes controlling widow spiders difficult is that they, like many spiders, exhibit a behavior called ballooning. When the spiderlings are very small, on warm days when there is an updraft, they climb to the top of a fence post or piece of vegetation, raise their abdomens into the air, and release a small filament of silk. When the updraft currents overtake the forces of gravity, the spiderling is carried into the air to another location. This may only be a few feet away, or it could be miles. Ballooning spiderlings have been captured at 10,000 feet from the ground and 200 miles offshore. Because spiderlings will be dropping down on your property continually, eliminating them will be a task that needs to be done repeatedly throughout the year. Chemical Control Typically, control of spiders using pesticides is difficult. Various insecticides are registered for control of spiders; including pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and combinations of these products. Curiously, most of these registered pesticides are water-based while the silk of spider egg sacs repels water. In a 2016 study, water-based insecticides sprayed on brown widow egg sacs provided no significant effect on the egg contents. However, when petroleum-based products were used, the pesticide was readily carried past the silk outer layer and killed the egg sac contents.\"},\n",

Females have slightly larger bodies and shorter legs than males. For the most part, the Zoropsis spider is a typical brown spider of varying shades of brown mixed with little black markings over most of its body. In many respects, it resembles a wolf spider. One distinctive mark is a longitudinal, black mark with several outward flares on the central top surface of the abdomen, near the cephalothorax (the part of the spider to which the legs attach). Be aware that there are some species of wolf spiders that also have a black mark in this area; but most often, the wolf spider mark is diamond-shaped with only one flare at the center. Zoropsis spiders also differ from wolf spiders in the eye arrangement. Zoropsis eyes are restricted to the front edge of the cephalothorax; in wolf spiders the eyes are spread across the front third of the cephalothorax. Zoropsis spinimana can be distinguished from other common household spiders by these features: its abdomen is elongate (never globular) and it is never found in orb webs hanging between trees or on porches. Zoropsis spinimana is a hunting spider (like wolf spiders), meaning it does not spin a web or use silk to subdue prey. Its silk is used primarily by the female to cover her egg sac. Like other spiders, its diet is primarily insects. Little information is available about the biology of this spider. Most specimens that have been submitted for identification are mature males and females; this means that people are finding wandering spiders that are searching for mates or roaming in search of food or for other reasons. Mature specimens have been found from September to May and are commonly encountered throughout the winter. It is not known where the immature spiders spend the summers or if this spider requires more than one season to mature. Despite the fact that this spider is large enough to be intimidating, Zoropsis spinimana is harmless. No spider in this genus is known to be medically important and there are no verified accounts of bites by this spider causing any significant medical problems.',\n",
       "       'damage': '',\n",
       "       'management': 'Zoropsis spiders are harmless and control of them is unnecessary. The ones you encounter will be wandering adults so there is little you can do to prevent them from showing up in your home. If you feel you must do something, general spider preventive measures include reducing the clutter around your home, which eliminates hiding places that spiders find attractive. Adding weather-stripping around the base of doors will help keep spiders and insects from entering your home. It is unlikely that you will encounter more than one of these spiders at once; Zoropsis spiders do not appear in groups or invade in large numbers. Capturing and placing the spider outside will probably end your arachnid encounter and will not increase the probability of running into the spider later on. You can remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar so that it seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Spiders are mostly beneficial because they feed on pest insects. However, many people think that all spiders are dangerous and aggressive. In California, the main spider capable of causing serious injury is the black widow, which generally remains outdoors and out of sight. Spiders seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people. Focus pest management efforts on removing webs and hiding places. Pesticides are not generally recommended. What to know about spiders: The jaws of most spiders are too small to bite humans. Adult female black widows are the main spiders capable of seriously injuring people in California. They are shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the underside and are commonly found outdoors, in sheltered, dry, undisturbed areas such as wood piles and garages. Anyone bitten by a black widow spider should remain calm and seek medical advice. The brown recluse spider and the hobo spider do not live in California. Some other spiders bite when trapped in clothing or bedding, but the effect is usually no more severe than itching or the reaction to a bee sting. To prevent spiders from entering your house, take these steps: Seal home foundation cracks and other access holes. Inspect window and door screens for good seals to keep out spiders and the insects they prey on. Keep areas around home foundations free of clutter. Manage spiders using these tips: Indoors, regular housecleaning provides adequate spider control. Vacuum up the spider and its web. Alternatively, squash spiders or capture them in a jar and release them outside. Prevent clutter buildup that can provide spider hiding places both indoors and out. Remove spider webs from the exterior of the house with a broom or high pressure hose. Spiders and biological control: When removing spiders, dont overlook the fact that spiders eat a large number and variety of nuisance and pest insects. Spiders also have natural enemieswasps, other spiders, birds, reptiles, and othersthat sometimes keep them from becoming too numerous.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'A parasite is an organism that lives and feeds in or on a larger animal (host). Nearly all insect pests have at least one parasite that attacks them. Insects that parasitize other invertebrates are parasitic only in their immature stages and kill their host just as they reach maturity. Most insect parasites (sometimes called parasitoids) are host-specific wasps or flies, and many are so small that often you wont see them. An adult parasite can lay eggs in hundreds of host individuals, resulting in the reduction of pest numbers. Life cycle of an aphid parasite (left). The adult female wasp (right) lays one egg in each aphid host; the egg develops into a larva, which feeds inside of and kills the aphid. The wasp larva pupates then emerges as an adult wasp. Parasitized aphids (left) die and turn into crusty \"mummies\" that can be black or beige. The hole in the aphid mummy (right) indicates a parasite has emerged. The blackish scale insects on the twig at left are discolored because wasp larvae are developing within. Once parasites mature into adults, they emerge through an exit hole (right). Some whitefly parasites turn hosts black; others do not. A good way to detect parasitization is to look for round exit holes in nymphs. A T-shaped slit indicates that a healthy whitefly emerged (far left). A circular hole indicates a parasite emerged (right). Caterpillar parasites include the Hyposoter exiguae wasp laying an egg in an armyworm (left). Pulling apart parasitized caterpillars can reveal the wasp larva within (right). Other signs of parasitized caterpillars: A Cotesia wasp forms white cocoons (left) outside its redhumped caterpillar host; at right, redhumped caterpillars are discolored and distorted due to a Hyposoter wasp pupating within. Some parasites, such as this Goniozus legneri on a navel orangeworm (left), lay many eggs externally on a host resulting in multiple wasp larvae feeding on a single caterpillar (right). Some parasites attack insect eggs, such as the Trissolcus wasp at left laying eggs in a stink bug egg cluster. The black corn earworm egg at right is dark because a Trichogramma wasp larva is developing inside. White eggs are healthy. Tachinid flies (left) parasitize many types of insects. Tachinid eggs laid on the caterpillar at right will hatch and, as larvae, bore into the host. Some tachinids lay eggs on plants and enter their insect hosts by being eaten.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Integrated pest management (IPM) involves the use of environmentally sound yet effective practices to keep pests from invading or damaging your home, garden, or landscape. IPM usually combines several methods for long-term pest prevention and management without harming you, your family, or the environment. Successful pest management begins with correctly identifying the pest and selecting the appropriate and most effective methods and materials. Pest prevention and control around the home and landscape includes: Monitoring for the presence of pests and their damage. Altering the home or garden environment to deprive pests of food, water, and shelter. Keeping pests out by using barriers, screens, and caulk. Planting pest-resistant or well-adapted plant varieties, such as native plants. Discouraging various pests by modifying the way you design, irrigate, fertilize, and manage your garden. Squashing, trapping, washing off, or pruning out pests; using mulch for weed control. Encouraging beneficial insects to live in your garden. Biological control Most gardens contain far more good bugs, or beneficial insects, than pest insects. Beneficial insects and other organisms (also called natural enemies) kill pests and play an important role in IPM. Help beneficials by choosing plants that provide pollen and nectar, by keeping ants out of pest-infested plants, and by avoiding the use of certain pesticides that kill or harm them. Learn to identify the adult and larval stages of common beneficials: Lady beetles (lady bugs): adults and larvae eat aphids. Lacewings: larvae feed on many insect pests; youll often see adults around lights. Syrphid flies: larvae eat aphids; adults resemble honey bees and hover around flowers. Parasitic mini-wasps: many species lay their eggs inside pests such as aphids or caterpillars; after hatching, the larvae consume the pest and kill it. Spiders: all spiders feed on insects or other arthropods. What about pesticides? Most pests can be managed without using pesticides. Use pesticides only if nonchemical controls are ineffective and monitoring confirms that pests are reaching intolerable or damaging levels. If pesticides are necessary, use them in combination with the nonchemical methods described above. Choose pesticides carefully. Use the least toxic, yet effective material that targets the pests but has little impact on human health and the environment. Examples of least toxic pesticides include: Soaps and oils. Microbials such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and spinosad. Borate products in bait stations for ants. Dusts such as borate or silica in cracks or crevices for household pests',\n",

The spiders commonly seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people.',\n",

       "       'development': 'Spiders resemble insects and sometimes are confused with them, but they are arachnids, not insects. Spiders have eight legs and two body partsa head region (cephalothorax) and an abdomen. They lack wings and antennae. Although spiders often are found on plants, they eat mainly insects, other spiders, and related arthropods, not plants. Most spiders have toxic venom, which they use to kill their prey. However, only those spiders whose venom typically causes a serious reaction in humans are called poisonous spiders. See the sidebar: Spider Bites. Table 1. Common Spider Families in North America. Agelenidae, funnel weavers or grass spiders Sit-and-wait predators feed during the day and night on the ground in most types of vegetation, including low-growing plants and trees. Spin funnel-shaped webs, often with several-inch-wide, flat extension covering plants or soil. The spider waits in the hole of its web. When it detects vibrations from an insect that flew or walked into the web, the spider runs out, captures and bites the prey, then carries it back into the funnel to be eaten. Webs on low vegetation become conspicuous in morning light after collecting dew. Funnel weavers have six or eight eyes, all about the same size, arranged in two rows. About 300 species in North America. Araneidae, orb weavers or garden spiders Feed on insects that fly, fall, or are blown into web. Elaborate silken webs are spun in concentric circles. Spiderlings often make symmetrical webs; mature spiders may spin a more specialized design that is helpful in identifying certain species. The spider rests at the center of its web or hides in a shelter near the edge, waiting for prey to become entangled. Orb weavers generally have poor vision and rely on web vibrations to locate and identify prey. About 200 species in North America. Clubionidae (including Corinnidae), sac spiders or twoclawed hunting spiders Stalk and capture prey that is walking or resting on surfaces. They spin silken tubes or sacs under bark, among leaves, and in low plants or on the ground, where they hide during the day or retreat after hunting. Commonly are nocturnal, medium-sized, pale spiders with few markings. About 200 species in North America. Linyphiidae (=Microphantidae), dwarf spiders Prey on insects that fall, walk, or land in their web. Diurnal (day active) spiders occurring in the plant canopy and among litter on the ground. They produce sheetlike webs on the surface of plants or soil and are common in some field and vegetable crops. Most are relatively small. Several hundred species in North America. Lycosidae, wolf spiders Prey on insects that are walking or resting on the ground. Actively hunt in the open during the day and night, often observed on the ground in litter and on low vegetation. Can occur in burrows and under debris on soil. Instead of spinning webs to catch prey, make a small, thick web where they rest. Have a distinctive pattern of eyes: four small eyes in front in a straight row, one middle pair of larger eyes, and one rear pair of widely spaced eyes on top of the head. They have long hairy legs. They are usually black and white or strongly contrasting light and dark, which can make them difficult to discern unless they are moving. About 200 species in North America. Oxyopidae, lynx spiders Stalk and capture resting or walking insects. Active hunters with good vision. Most have spiny legs and a brightly colored body that tapers sharply toward the rear. They have four pairs of eyes grouped in a hexagon. About 2 dozen known species in North America. Salticidae, jumping spiders Day-active hunters in plants or on the ground. They make no web; instead they stalk and pounce on prey by jumping distances many times their body length. Jumping spiders have a distinctive pattern of eyes in three rows: the first row of four eyes, with large and distinctive middle eyes; a second row of two very small to minute eyes; and a third row of two medium sized eyes. They usually have an iridescent, metallic-colored abdomen and black carapace. About 300 species in North America. Theridiidae, cobweb, cobweb weaver, or combfooted spiders Feed on insects that walk or fly into their webs. Almost always found hanging upside down by their claws in irregularly spun, sticky webs, waiting for prey. The spider is usually concealed in a corner of the web, in a silken tent, or behind debris. This group includes the black widow spider, which produces relatively thick silk that feels rough and sticky. They generally have a soft, round, bulbous abdomen and slender legs without spines. Over 200 species in North America. Thomisidae, crab spiders or flower spiders Stalk and capture insects walking or resting on surfaces. Diurnal hunters that do not spin webs. Front two pairs of legs are enlarged and extend beyond the side of their flattened body, making them look like tiny crabs. Their small eyes occur in two slightly curved rows, with the top row often much wider than the lower row. Over 200 species in North America. Black Widow Spider The black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most common harmful spider in California. Venom from its bite can cause reactions ranging from mild to painful and serious, but death is very unlikely and many symptoms can be alleviated if medical treatment is obtained. Anyone bitten by this spider should remain calm and promptly seek medical advice; it is helpful if the offending spider can be caught and saved for identification. The typical adult female black widow has a shiny black body, slender black legs, and a red or orange mark in the shape of an hourglass on the underside of the large, round abdomen. The body, excluding legs, is 5/16 to 5/8 inch long. Only the larger immature female and adult female spiders are able to bite through a persons skin and inject enough venom to cause a painful reaction. The adult male black widow is one-half to two-thirds the length of the female, has a small abdomen, and is seldom noticed. The male black widow does possess venom, but its fangs are too small to break human skin. The top side of its abdomen is olive-greenish gray with a pattern of cream-colored areas and one light-colored band going lengthwise down the middle. The hourglass mark on the underside of the abdomen typically is yellow or yellow-orange and broad waisted. The legs are banded with alternating light and dark areas. Contrary to popular belief, the female black widow rarely eats the male after mating but may do so if hungry. Like males, young female black widow spiders are patterned on the top side. In the early stages they greatly resemble males but gradually acquire the typical female coloration with each shedding of the skin. In intermediate stages they have tan or cream-colored, olive-gray, and orange markings on the top side of the abdomen, a yellowish orange hourglass mark on the underside, and banded legs. Webs and Egg Sacs The web of the black widow is an irregular, tough-stranded, sticky cobweb mesh in which the spider hangs with its underside up. During the day it often hides under an object at the edge of the web or stays in a silken retreat in the center. The black widow may rush out of its hiding place when the web is disturbed, especially if egg sacs are present. The egg sacs are mostly spherical, about 1/2 inch long and 5/8 inch in diameter, creamy yellow to light tan in color, opaque, and tough and paperlike on the surface. A female may produce several egg sacs. Tiny, young black widows, which are nearly white in color, disperse to new locations by ballooning and infest new areas. Spider Bites Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-222-1222). Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, apply an antiseptic to prevent infection, and use ice or ice water to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary, try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist. Where the Spiders Live. Black widow spiders occur in most parts of California. They and their associated webs usually are found in dark, dry, sheltered, relatively undisturbed places such as among piles of wood, rubbish, or stones; in culverts, hollow stumps, and old animal burrows; in garages, sheds, barns, crawl spaces, utility meter boxes, and outhouses; and sometimes among plants. People are most likely to be bitten when they disturb the spider while they are cleaning out or picking up items in such places. A sensible precaution is to always wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt when working in areas that have been undisturbed for a time and where there are good hiding places for spiders. Effects of the Bite. The symptoms of a black widow bite are largely internal; little more than local redness and swelling may develop at the bite site. The internal effects may range from mild to severe. Pain tends to spread from the bite to other parts of the body and muscular spasms may develop. In severe cases the abdominal muscles may become quite rigid. Other effects can include profuse sweating, fever, increased blood pressure, difficulty breathing and speaking, restlessness, and nausea. Typically, the pain and other symptoms reach a maximum within a day of the bite, then gradually subside over the next 2 to 3 days. Most people who are bitten spend a few hours under observation by a physician but do not develop symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Small children, the elderly, and persons with health problems are likely to suffer some of the more severe consequences of the bite. Black widow bites are fairly common in California. Yellow Sac Spider The common, house-dwelling agrarian sac or yellow sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum, is a small spider that spins a silken sac web in the corners of ceilings and walls, and behind shelves and pictures; it is also commonly found outdoors in shrubbery. This spider is light yellow and has a slightly darker stripe on the upper middle of the abdomen. The eight eyes of this spider are all about equal in size and arranged in two horizontal rows. Yellow sac spiders can be seen running on walls and ceilings at night and quickly drop to the floor to escape if they are disturbed. Bites usually occur when the spider becomes trapped against a persons skin in clothing or bedding. It is estimated that sac spiders are responsible for more bites on people than any other spider. Typical symptoms of a bite include initial pain, redness, and sometimes swelling. Recluse Spiders Recluse spiders of the genus Loxosceles include the well-known brown recluse spider, L. reclusa, which does not occur in California. While the brown recluse has occasionally been brought into California in household furnishings, firewood, and motor vehicles, it does not reside in the state. However, populations of another recluse spider, the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta), were found in Los Angeles County in the late 1960s. In its native Chile it is known to have a bite that is toxic to humans. The native recluse spider of California (L. deserta) is found in the desert regions of southern California and neighboring states. Its bite can cause problems, but it is not as toxic as that of the Chilean recluse. In any case, bites from the desert recluse are rare and no bites from the Chilean recluse have ever been recorded in California despite its presence in heavily populated urban areas. Both the native desert recluse spider and the Chilean recluse spider occur principally in the drier areas of southern California. Recluse spiders can have a violin-shaped mark (with the neck of the violin pointing backward) on the top side of the head region (cephalothorax). However, the mark is not always distinct, so it should not be used as an identifying character. A unique feature of recluse spiders is their six eyes, arranged in pairs in a semicircle, which can be seen with the use of a good hand lens. Most other spiders have eight eyes. All recluse spiders make large, irregular, flattened, cobweb-type webs with thick strands extending in all directions. These spiders avoid light, are active at night, and tend to build their webs in out-of-the-way places. Chilean recluse spiders may be found indoors in boxes, in corners, behind pictures, in old clothing hanging undisturbed, and in other similar places. Desert recluse spiders appear outdoors where they may be found under rocks or wood. More detailed information on these spiders is available in Pest Notes: Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders . Other Spiders In addition to the species mentioned above, there are only a few other species of spiders in California that may on occasion bite humans. (Remember, if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician). One kind of red and black jumping spider, Phidippus johnsoni, may bite if it is disturbed, but the bites are usually not serious. The female spiders are black with red on the top side of the abdomen whereas the males are all red. These spiders range in size from 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Tarantulas are long-lived spiders that occupy burrows in the ground during the day but often come out at night to hunt insects near the burrow. They commonly are feared because of their large size and hairy appearance. Some poisonous tarantulas occur in tropical parts of the world, but the bites of California tarantulas are not likely to be seriousat worst, they are similar to a bee sting. However, because of the variety of tarantulas sold in the pet trade industry, there is a spectrum of venom potencies among these creatures. These spiders ranges from 1 to 2 inches in body size. The hobo spider, Tegenaria agrestis, also called the aggressive house spider, is a common spider in the Pacific Northwest. It builds funnel-shaped webs in dark, moist areas such as basements, window wells, wood piles, and around the perimeter of homes. It is a large (1 to 13/4 inch, including legs), fast-running brown spider with a herringbone or multiple chevron pattern on the top of the abdomen. The hobo spider has not been documented in California, but it has expanded its range from the Pacific Northwest to northern Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Although it has been stated as being a poisonous spider, recent research is challenging the original data that elevated this spider to medical importance. See Pest Notes: Hobo Spiders . One spider frequently found indoors is the common house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, which makes a cobweb in corners of rooms, in windows, and in similar places. Another is the marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, which was introduced into the state in the 1970s and has since displaced the once common longbodied cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides, a long-legged spider that resembles a daddy-longlegs. These spiders are only marginally capable of biting humans because their fangs are too short to pierce peoples skin; they primarily cause problems by producing messy cobwebs. Various kinds of small hunting spiders may wander indoors and occasionally, rather large, hunting-type spiders are discovered in homes or garages. Often these are fully grown wolf spider or tarantula males that have reached maturity and are searching for females. When these spiders are wandering, one or more may accidentally get indoors. New houses and other structures in developments may be invaded by wolf spiders that have lost their usual outdoor living places. The more insects that exist inside a building, the more likely it is to have spiders living there. Usually spiders are most abundant in fall following the first few rains of the season. Immature and adult female burrow-living spiders sometimes wander for a time during the rainy season if they have had to abandon wet burrows.',\n",

       "       'management': 'Spiders may enter houses and other structures through cracks and other openings. They also may be carried in on items like plants, firewood, and boxes. To prevent spiders from coming indoors, seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors. Good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they prey upon. Regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, basements, and other seldom used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive the tumbling process through the hose. Indoors, a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider because occupied spider webs are maintained for cleanliness to enhance prey capture. Individual spiders can also be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. They can then be released outdoors. Watch this video to learn more: How to catch a spider. In indoor storage areas, place boxes off the floor and away from walls, whenever possible, to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders. Sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within. Clean up clutter in garages, sheds, basements, and other storage areas. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Outdoors, eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash, leaf litter, heavy vegetation, and other accumulations of materials. Trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attracts spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Chemical Control: Insecticides will not provide long-term control and should not generally be used against spiders outdoors. Typically, controlling spiders with pesticides is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control, including pyrethrins and pyrethroids (synthetic versions of pyrethrins) such as resmethrin, allethrin, or combinations of these products. Control by spraying is only temporary unless accompanied by housekeeping. It is just as easy and much less toxic to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe or to vacuum it up. Sticky traps offer a noninsecticidal way to remove spiders from your home as long as you can place the traps where pets and children cant tamper with them. Sorptive dusts containing amorphous silica gel (silica aerogel) and pyrethrins, which can be applied by professional pest control applicators only, may be useful in certain indoor situations. Sorptive dust particles affect the outer covering of spiders (and also insects) that have crawled over a treated surface, causing them to dry out and die. When applied as a dustlike film and left in place, a sorptive dust provides permanent protection against spiders. The dust is most safely and effectively used in cracks and crevices and in attics, wall voids, and other enclosed or unused places. SPIDER BITES: Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically, the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-876-4766 or 1-800-8-POISON). One must also keep in mind that although it is impossible to be certain, people and their physicians often blame spiders as the cause of skin lesions with no proof of spider involvement when there are many similar-appearing, non-spider maladies; therefore, care must be exerted in the diagnostic process. Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, and use ice, ice water or cold compresses to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Protect spiders in your garden because they prey on insects and other pests. Most spiders observed in the open during the day are not likely to bite you or cause lasting harm if they do bite you. Spiders whose bites might require you to seek medical attention spend most of their time hidden. Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have 8 legs and 2 body partsan abdomen and a combined head and thorax. They lack wings and antennae. Spider families vary by body shape, web type, hunting or other behavior, and the arrangement and relative size of their eyes. Cellar spiders have long, skinny legs and hang upside down in dark corners, often indoors, sometimes bouncing when disturbed. The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, is shown here. Cobweb spiders hang upside down in sticky, irregularly spun webs waiting for prey. Most cobweb species are small and harmless, such as this Theridion dilutum. Western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most well-known cobweb spider. Most black widow bites come from mature adult females (left), which can usually be recognized by a red hourglass on the underside of the abdomen. The adult male (right) is lighter-colored and smaller than the female. Crab or flower spiders, such as Misumena vatia, have enlarged front legs. They hunt during the day without webs. Dwarf spiders are tiny, hunt during the day, and produce sheetlike or irregular crisscross webs on surfaces. Funnel weavers spin thick, flattened webs and sit at the center of a silken hole, or funnel, running out to capture prey that contact the web. Often seen are Hololena nedra (left) and the common house spider, Tegenaria species, (right) found in gardens and on walls and ceilings inside the house. Lynx spiders are active hunters that stalk and capture prey. Legs are spiny, and the abdomen is narrowest at the rear. They dont spin webs. Shown here is a green lynx spider, Peucetia viridans . Jumping spiders hunt during the day, stalking and pouncing on prey. They are hairy, sometimes iridescent, and dont spin webs. This Phidippus species is eating a house fly. Orb weaver or garden spiders, such as this western spotted orb weaver, Neoscona oaxacensis, (left) often are large and colorful and wait in their webs or nearby for prey to become entangled. They spin elaborate webs in concentric circles in the garden. Sac spiders hide in silk tubes in places such as corners, beneath plants, or on bark, and stalk prey at night. They occur indoors and out and usually are pale, such as this agrarian sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum. Wolf spiders have long, hairy legs and are often found running along the ground. They dont build webs to capture prey but can have a silken retreat. Females carry young on their backs.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'There are two species of widow spiders in California, the western black widow and the brown widow. Both are in the genus Latrodectus and are characterized by a similar body shape, reclusive habit, and irregular cobwebs. The western black widow, a native species, is widespread, and is the spider posing the greatest potential envenomation threat to humans in the western United States. It is well known in many localities, and nonprofessionals can identify it easily. In the first decade of the 21st century, the non-native brown widow became established in southern California. Although it isn\\'t nearly as dangerous as the black widow, it causes alarm because of the reputation of its relative. BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS Several species of black widow are common in North America, but in the western United States the only species present is the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus. Its habitat ranges from British Columbia and Alberta to Mexico and throughout the Rocky Mountains to the western portions of the Great Plains. In California, it is a common desert spider that can survive very hot, dry conditions. However, black widows also can be found in mountainous terrain above 5,000-foot elevation in Southern California, where snow covers the ground every winter. Outside California, western black widows are common in urban Colorado, in central and eastern Washington state, and in southern British Columbia. Because the holes, cracks, crevices, trash, and clutter associated with human structures provide ideal habitat for the western black widow, these spiders are often very common around homes, barns, outbuildings, and rock walls. In such supportive habitats, mature females can be found every few feet and sometimes within inches of each other. Identification A mature female western black widow spider is about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in body length, and has a rounded abdomen and very characteristic coloration. She is shiny jet black all over her body and legs, except for a red pattern on the underside of the abdomen, which looks, in perfect specimens, like an hourglass. Some specimens have a brownish or plum-colored tinge, but usually these are females that are so well fed that the black-pigmented abdomen has been stretched until it looks brown instead of black. The red hourglass varies in appearance; it can be two perfect triangles with points merged to make a perfect hourglass, two triangles separated by a space, a triangle and a small bar, minimal or almost imperceptible red coloration, or, on rare occasions, completely absent. The false black widow, which is discussed below, is chocolate brown and never has red coloration, although many people frequently mistake it for a black widow. As easy as it is to identify an adult female black widow, the immatures, looking nothing like the mother, can be difficult to recognize. When black widow spiderlings emerge from their egg sac, they have tan legs and a tan cephalothorax (the body part to which the legs attach), while the abdomen is mostly white with a few black spots. As the spider grows, the background coloration of the abdomen becomes olive-gray or tan; and there is a longitudinal white stripe on the top of the abdomen and diagonal stripes on the flanks, with a small black dot at the uppermost portion of each diagonal stripe. As the spiderlings continue to grow larger, they molt, like all spiders, in order to shed their restrictive exoskeletons. With successive molts in females, the white stripes become thinner, the olive-gray or tan coloration darkens toward black, and eventually the spider acquires its well-known black coloration. Some mature females retain one or two conspicuous, indented white lines on the front surface of the abdomen that look like a corporal\\'s chevrons. In the youngest spiders, the space where the hourglass develops starts off being a whitish shield. As the spider grows and molts several times, the color of this shield turns from white-yellow to orange-red and changes from a shield with a thick middle portion to an hourglass with a thin, tapered middle. In contrast to the female, the male black widow retains the coloration of the juvenile. After it matures, it stops eating and its abdomen shrinks (its only task at this point is to mate). The male still retains one longitudinal abdominal stripe and a set of diagonal flank stripes on each side of the abdomen. The males are much smaller than the females in body length, although sometimes their legs are almost as long as those of the adult female. Egg Sac The egg sac of the western black widow is yellowish and teardrop-shaped, tapered at the top and bulbous at the bottom. The margins of the sac are well defined (as opposed to some spider egg sacs, which look like fluffy cotton balls, making it difficult to determine exactly where the egg sac starts). The egg sac covering is very tough and difficult to rip apart. A female western black widow typically lays about 300 eggs per sac. Because females can store sperm from their only mating, they can produce more than 10 egg sacs without subsequent matings and without a decrease in the number of eggs or a reduction in the percentage of eggs that will successfully hatch into spiderlings. Habitat The western black widow is found in populated areas almost everywhere in California. Although they can be found in homes, black widows typically nest outside, around the home in holes and crevices, and within clutter. In garages, they usually make webs by doors, near vents, and in other places where insects may pass by. Because most people don\\'t tolerate large numbers of insects in their living spaces, widow spiders usually won\\'t find sufficient prey to survive inside homes. Black widows are shy spiders that seek retreats, such as holes between bricks or spaces around pipe penetrations in walls, where they can hide during the day and then come out at night. In natural settings, you can often find them in rodent burrows and crevices in rock faces. The spider makes a web of tangled silk extending from this retreat hole. The web doesn\\'t have a very recognizable pattern, although it does have vertical support threads above and below the central areas where the spider sits while it waits for prey at night. The lower support threads also alert the widow to the presence of a prey item blundering into the web. In most cases, a widow spider will seek a retreat near the ground as the home base for her web, which connects to the retreat, allowing the spider to emerge to catch both flying and crawling prey at night, usually within three feet of the ground. However, some spiders will make a retreat well above ground level, such as in the eave of a house, and then drop down 10 or more feet before building their web. Widow spiders come out at dusk. After making improvements to their existing web, they take up a position in the middle, their underside facing upward, to wait for prey. Any large disturbance of the web that indicates something larger than a prey item causes the spider to quickly move toward the safety of its retreat. The silk of a mature black widow is very strong. If you run your finger through the web of a large spider, the result is an audible ripping sound. Black widow silk is so strong that during World War II, it was used to make crosshairs for gun sights. Medical Aspects Bites from black widow spiders are quite rare, even where these spiders are very common. In the unlikely event of an actual bite from a black widow, the bite itself is painless or may feel like a little pinprick. Almost all medically important black widow bites are from the adult female, which is much larger than the male. The female also has stronger biting muscles and a larger venom reserve. At the site of the bite, there may be a little red mark or red streaking away from the bite. Within an hour, other symptoms may start to appear. Bite victims might suffer from some but not all of the following symptoms: Rigid stomach muscles, which some medical professionals have misdiagnosed as appendicitis Sweating, sometimes of just the bitten body part, such as a bite to the hand that results in only the arm sweating profusely Pain that can be local, radiating, or regional Urine retention Numbness, agitation, fever, and patchy paralysis (less common) Another sign of envenomation is that bite victims will sometimes move or rock back and forth incessantly to try to lessen the pain from the venom injection process. Although these are the most severe manifestations of black widow bites, symptoms most often merely resemble those of the flu. Black widow bites don\\'t cause conspicuous swelling, necrosis, or deterioration of tissue around the bite. As a neurotoxin, the venom of a black widow affects the nerve-muscle junction in the body. Normally, the body\\'s neurons work like a light switch: they make the muscle turn on and then off again so that the muscle can relax and be ready to contract again if needed. The venom causes the muscle to repeatedly contract. It would be like flipping on a light switch and not being able to turn it off again. If bitten, seek medical attention immediately. You can place a cold pack on the bite to relieve the pain. An antivenom for black widow bites is available that works for all species that have been tested worldwide. Response is fast, and bite victims can go from intense pain back to normal in 30 minutes. The antivenom is based on horse serum, so physicians need to monitor for anaphylactic shock. American physicians are somewhat reluctant to use antivenom for this reason and might prefer to have the bite victim simply endure the symptoms, which can be similar to those of a bad flu episode and usually dissipate in a few days. BROWN WIDOW SPIDERS The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is found worldwide in subtropical habitats. It probably originated from Africa, or possibly from South America. In North America, the brown widow was found only in Florida for many decades, where it remains rather common. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the spider began appearing elsewhere, from Texas throughout the Gulf Coast states and up the Atlantic coast into South Carolina. While they were expanding in the southeastern United States, brown widows started being discovered in great numbers in Southern California, where they have caused great concern within the general public. Initial news reports exaggerated the impact of the brown widow. However, unlike that of the black widow, the bite of this spider is not much more toxic to humans than that of other common spiders. Identification Mature female brown widows are smaller than mature female western black widows, being about 3/8\" in body length (10 mm). The normal brown widow spider coloration is a mottled collection of tan, brown, and gray. It has a lengthwise stripe halfway up the back side of the abdomen with two isolated dots in front of it and diagonal stripes on the side, somewhat similar to immature western black widow spiders (see Table 1). However, the usual background coloration of the brown widow is more of a tan, as compared to the western black widow, in which background coloration is more olive-gray. Male brown widows are much smaller [body length: 3/16 inch (4 to 5 mm)] than other widow spiders and therefore might be overlooked or misidentified. There is, however, great variation in brown widow coloration. Spiders can vary from almost white to almost black. When brown widows are very dark, though, this coloration is closer to a flat black than a shiny black like that of a mature black widow female. A mature brown widow female looks very similar to an immature western black widow, thus some skill is needed to identify the two accurately. However, the brown widow egg sac, as described in the next paragraph, is distinctive and a much surer way to confirm the species. Table 1. Features used to distinguish brown widows from immature western black widows. Feature Brown widow Black widow (immature) Black spots on lateral abdominal stripes large, squarish small, elliptical Hourglass bottom half larger top half larger rough margins crisp, straight margins White markings on front of abdomen not continuous continuous Egg Sac The egg sac of the brown widow spider has protuberances of silk all over its surface, resembling a very large pollen grain. The sac is so characteristic that it can be used to verify the presence of brown widows even if the spiders themselves are not seen. Brown widows produce about 130 eggs per egg sac and are able to make 20 or more egg sacs in a lifetime, sometimes multiple sacs within a short time period. Female brown widows can be collected with several simultaneously-developing egg sacs. Habitat The habitat of the brown widow is similar in many respects to that of the black widow. They generally reside in cluttered areas outside, such as woodpiles, but you will also find them in more exposed areas, such as on chain-link fences where black widows normally would not be found. They are also extremely common in the nooks and crannies on the undersides of inexpensive plastic patio furniture. Brown widow spiders make irregular webs of strong silk, similar to those of western black widows. Both black widows and brown widows are almost never found in homes. In garages, black widows are common but brown widows are not. Outside and around the home, both spiders are very common. The brown widow appears to be displacing the black widow in some of its habitats, especially in urban areas. Southern California residents frequently mention that they used to have a few black widows, but now only can find brown widows (and in greater numbers). In a study published in 2012, brown widows outnumbered black widows in urban areas; such as around homes, in parks (especially under playground equipment), in zoos, etc. The same study, however, reported that brown widows were not found in natural areas in southern California (such as in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat) and were rare around agricultural buildings. Brown widows were occasionally found in agricultural crops such as citrus, apple, and avocado trees as well as in corn stalks, bird-of-paradise leaves and other plants, but most of these finds were in vegetation associated with small home gardens rather than large commercial properties. As of 2016, brown widows were well established from Santa Barbara to the San Bernardino area and south to Mexico. Established populations have not yet been found north of the Los Angeles Basin, in the Central Valley, or in the desert areas (which may be inhospitable for them due to the arid climate). Although unsubstantiated reports of brown widows occurring north of the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara region (such as in the San Francisco Bay area) have been made for years, submitted spiders have been immature black widows, Steatoda (false black widow) spiders of several species, or orbweavers. However, it is possible that the brown widow is continuing to expand its range in California. Medical Aspects The bite of the brown widow is much milder than that of the western black widow. In a study in Africa, the most common symptoms in 15 verified bites were that the bite hurt when it happened and that there was burning pain at the bite site. None of these patients developed the typical dynamic symptoms of black widow envenomation. Despite these observations, there is one American record of a verified bite where the patient developed more severe symptoms and required hospitalization. Although its venom is at least as potent as black widow venom (drop for drop, as tested in mice), the brown widow is smaller and likely injects much less venom during a bite. In addition, bites to people are unlikely since brown widows, when disturbed, typically pull their legs close to the body, drop from their web, and play dead. The recent arrival of the brown widow in Southern California is not a cause for alarm. In fact, if the brown widow is indeed displacing the more toxic black widow, there actually might be a reduction in spider bite risk as compared to previous decades. OTHER RELATED SPIDERS False Black Widow The false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, is not a true widow spider; however, it is in the same family, Theridiidae, as widow spiders and can easily be confused with them. It shares the same rounded-abdomen body form and web-making traits. It is slightly smaller than a mature western black widow spider [body length: 3/8 inch (10 mm)], chocolate brown in color, and never has red coloration on its belly. The false black widow is a European immigrant that has become extremely common in Pacific Coast homes from San Diego to British Columbia, with isolated finds in Alaska. Unlike black widows, false black widow spiders thrive indoors, especially in washrooms, inside cupboards and underneath appliances, furniture and cabinets. False black widows make an egg sac that looks like a cotton ball with indistinct margins. Unlike black widow spiders, false black widow spiderlings are dark like their mothers when they emerge. Because they are common in homes, false black widows are more frequently involved in bite incidents than black widow or brown widow spiders. They have mild venom, and bites may cause symptoms similar to those of yellowjacket wasp stings: initial burning pain followed by minor localized swelling around the envenomation site. When black widow antivenom mistakenly has been used on false black widow bites, it appeared to eliminate the venom\\'s effects. Noble False Widow Spider In 2011, Steatoda nobilis was discovered in Southern California. Like the false black widow, this spider is a European native. Mature females can reach 5/8 inch (14 mm) in body length, which is significantly larger than the false black widow. Instead of being uniformly colored on the top surface of the abdomen as is the false black widow, Steatoda nobilis usually has a light tan pattern somewhat resembling a house with two windows and a domed roof. However, in some specimens, only the remnant tip of the \"roof\" is exhibited. There is also a broad, tan band on the front-facing surface of the abdomen. This spider was first found in Ventura County. It is now widespread in coastal San Diego County, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay area. Isolated finds have occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Bites from this species are not considered to be medically significant. There have been two recorded bites from the spider, with minor symptom development, but because of its large size, it has the potential to hurt merely from fang penetration. This spider will probably continue to spread throughout coastal California.',\n",

       "       'management': \"Minimizing sites around the home where spiders may hide, such as clutter, woodpiles, and heavy ground cover, is essential for reducing widow spider populations. However, it is not practical to eliminate these spiders completely. Both widow species will continue to re-infest treated areas. Regularly vacuuming or sweeping windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, and other seldom-used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually don't survive this process. In the garage, keep items such as gardening clothes and gloves in bags closed with zipper-locks or twist ties. Store seasonal items such as sports gear, camping gear, winter clothes or holiday decorations in boxes that can be taped shut and placed off the floor away from walls in order to exclude spiders. When cleaning up clutter in garages and other storage areas, be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Other areas to check carefully include children's toys or playhouses made of molded plastic that have open spaces facing downward where spiders can crawl in. Additional favored habitats of widow spiders include picnic tables, trash can grips, lawn chairs, plant pots with curled lips, and other outdoor objects with sheltered lips or crevices. Be careful that you do not carry spiders indoors on items such as plants, firewood, and boxes. Stack woodpiles away from your house, and never pick up pieces of wood unless you are wearing gloves. Eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping areas near building foundations free of trash, leaf litter, and accumulations of other materials. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attract spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures pointed off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides do not provide long-term control. Because widow spiders are nocturnal, a nonchemical method of eradication is to search for them at night with a flashlight and kill them with a shoe or rolled up newspaper. If you are concerned about wildlife and feel comfortable doing so, you can remove individual spiders from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper underneath to seal off the opening when you lift the jar. Release the spider about 100 feet from your home into a natural area. Brown widows may not survive in natural areas but on the other hand, they are an invasive, non-native pest species and should not be there anyway. One aspect that makes controlling widow spiders difficult is that they, like many spiders, exhibit a behavior called ballooning. When the spiderlings are very small, on warm days when there is an updraft, they climb to the top of a fence post or piece of vegetation, raise their abdomens into the air, and release a small filament of silk. When the updraft currents overtake the forces of gravity, the spiderling is carried into the air to another location. This may only be a few feet away, or it could be miles. Ballooning spiderlings have been captured at 10,000 feet from the ground and 200 miles offshore. Because spiderlings will be dropping down on your property continually, eliminating them will be a task that needs to be done repeatedly throughout the year. Chemical Control Typically, control of spiders using pesticides is difficult. Various insecticides are registered for control of spiders; including pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and combinations of these products. Curiously, most of these registered pesticides are water-based while the silk of spider egg sacs repels water. In a 2016 study, water-based insecticides sprayed on brown widow egg sacs provided no significant effect on the egg contents. However, when petroleum-based products were used, the pesticide was readily carried past the silk outer layer and killed the egg sac contents.\"},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Contrary to popular belief, there are no populations of the brown recluse, Loxosceles reclusa, in California. In fact, fewer than 20 verified specimens have been collected in the state over several decades by spider experts. Yet people in California frequently relate stories in which they or someone they know was supposedly bitten or they have had a physician diagnose them with a brown recluse spider bite. Black widows on the other hand, are very common throughout the state, causing potentially serious injury with their bite. The adult females are easily identifiable by their shiny black body color and red hourglass on the belly. For information on black widows, see the Pest Notes: Widow Spiders and Their Relatives. Although the brown recluse does not live in California, four species of native recluse spiders occur in southern areas of the state and can cause similar medical concerns. The most common Californian recluse spider is the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta . It is found mostly in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, in the foothills of the lower San Joaquin Valley, and in adjacent areas of Mexico; most of these areas are sparsely populated by humans. This publication was written to provide science-based information about the status of the brown recluse and other related spiders in California. COMMON AND SCIENTIFIC NAMES Over the years, the group of spiders to which the brown recluse belongs has been known by various colloquial names: \"violin\" spiders, \"fiddleback\" spiders, \"recluse\" spiders, and \"brown\" spiders. The recluse spiders are in the family Sicariidae (formerly Loxoscelidae). The scientific name for the recluse spider genus is Loxosceles (lox-SOS-a-leez) and rhymes somewhat with \"isosceles\" as in the triangle. Whereas \"isosceles\" means equal legs, \"loxosceles\" means slanted legs, referring to the way the recluse spiders hold their legs at rest. All known members of the group have scientific names, and the more familiar members of this group also have common names (e.g., brown recluse, desert recluse, Arizona recluse).',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'The most definitive physical feature of recluse spiders is their eyes : most spiders have 8 eyes that typically are arranged in 2 rows of 4, but recluse spiders have 6 equal-sized eyes arranged in 3 pairs, each pair called dyads. There is a dyad at the front of the cephalothorax (the first main body part to which the legs attach) and another dyad on each side further back with a space separating the dyads from one another. Many publications refer to the \"violin\" marking on the dorsal (top) surface of the cephalothorax (head region) as the most important diagnostic feature. Although this marking is fairly consistent in mature brown recluses and Texan recluses (Loxosceles devia), it can vary in intensity, sometimes fading on preserved specimens, and it is very faint to nonexistent in several recluse species found in the southwestern United States (e.g., the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta). Therefore, checking the eye pattern is the best way to eliminate almost all suspect non-recluse spiders from consideration, whereas the presence or absence of the violin marking may lead to misidentifications. Non-arachnologists (including physicians, pest control operators, and even some entomologists) have envisioned \"violins\" on various body surfaces of harmless spiders and incorrectly assume that they have properly identified a brown recluse spider. In addition, the abdomens of all North American recluses are covered with fine hairs and are uniformly colored (not patterned), although the coloration can vary from light beige to dark brown, depending in part on what they have eaten recently. There is never a color pattern on the abdomen of North American specimens. Finally, the uniformly colored legs are similarly covered with fine hairs whereas many non-recluse spiders have stout spines and a pattern of stripes, rings, or spots on their legs. Some other spiders share one or more of these physical characteristics. However, to be identified as a recluse spider, it must have all 5 of these characteristics. six eyes in dyads (pairs) uniformly colored abdomen with fine hairs no spines on the legs uniformly colored legs body not more than 3/8\" in length On this basis, more than 99% of the spiders found by Californians can be identified as something other than a recluse spider. In the unlikely event that one does find a recluse spider in California, it will most likely be the native desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta. To identify Loxosceles spiders to species level requires a high-magnification microscope and the skills of a spider expert (arachnologist). SPIDERS COMMONLY CONFUSED WITH RECLUSES Because of the misinformation surrounding the brown recluse\\'s presence in California, many spiders that are virtually harmless are submitted by the public to arachnologists for identification. Most of them are not from the recluse family and some are not even spiders. A nationwide study was undertaken from 2000 to 2005, offering to identify any spider that was considered to be a brown recluse spider. Nearly 600 specimens were submitted from California, many from people who were adamant that they had a brown recluse. Only one of these specimens was a brown recluse, from a house where the family had moved from Missouri, a state that is well-known to have abundant brown recluse populations. No additional recluses were found in the house. The occasional finding of a translocated brown recluse spider is not surprising; however, it still is extremely rare. There were 17 desert recluse spiders submitted in this study, all from the desert regions of southeastern California where the spiders are known to occur. Non-recluse spiders were submitted in great numbers including many false black widows, woodlouse, and yellow sac spiders. Presented below are descriptions of spiders that share some of the same physical features as the brown recluse and have been misidentified as recluse spiders. For additional information on these spiders, consult a spider identification book such as Common Spiders of North America by Richard Bradley, listed in the References section or the table of common spider families found in California, located in the Pest Notes: Spiders . Six-Eyed Spiders Spitting spiders (Scytodes spp.) are closely related to recluse spiders and have 6 eyes arranged in a similar pattern. However, unlike recluse spiders, they also have many black spots or lines on their bodies and a strongly domed cephalothorax. The woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata, has 6 eyes arranged in 2 groups of 3 (triads) and no bodily markings. Spiders with Violin-Shaped or Other Dark Markings Many common tan or gray spiders have dark markings on the head region, which convinces people that they have caught a true recluse spider. These spiders include cellar spiders (Pholcus phalangioides, Psilochorus spp., Physocyclus spp.), pirate spiders (Mimetus spp.), and sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae family). The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, also confuses people even though the dark marks are on the ventral (underside) not the dorsal (top) surface of the body. The most common submissions as brown recluses are spiders in the genus Titiotus . These spiders are found just north of Los Angeles, through central California to Redding and are common in forests. Titiotus spiders have a hair pattern that gives the impression of a violin and its coloration is similar to that of a brown recluse. Another frequent submission is Zoropsis spinimana, which is found in the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento. It is a harmless Mediterranean immigrant species, first detected in California around 1995. It is large and frequently captured in homes. Residents see the dark marking on the top surface of the abdomen as a violin, but recluses have this type of marking on their cephalothorax. See the Pest Notes: Zoropsis spinimana, A Mediterranean Spider in California for more information. Ubiquitous Brown Spiders Virtually every spider that is tan or brown has been turned in by Californians as a potential brown recluse. There are hundreds of species of these spiders in California. They include ground spiders (Gnaphosidae), sac spiders (Cheiracanthium spp., Trachelas spp.), wolf spiders (Lycosidae), grass spiders (Agelenidae), orb weavers (Araneidae), and male crevice spiders (Filistatidae). Additionally, males of both the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the false black widow, Steatoda grossa, are frequently brought in as suspected recluse spiders. All of these brown spiders have 8 eyes and thus can be quickly eliminated from consideration. AMERICAN RECLUSE SPIDERS Eleven species of recluse spiders are native to the United States and two non-natives have become established in certain highly-limited areas of the country. The brown recluse spider is the proper common name for only one species, Loxosceles reclusa . It is the most widespread of the North American recluse spiders and lives in the south central Midwest from southeastern Nebraska to southwestern Ohio and south through Texas to north Georgia. In addition to these native species, the Chilean recluse spider, Loxosceles laeta (pronounced \"LEE-ta\"), has become established in portions of Los Angeles (Alhambra, Sierra Madre, Monterey Park, and San Gabriel). This spider, however, seems to be confined to a very limited area in Los Angeles County, has been present there for at least 80 years (one specimen was collected from Los Angeles in 1936) and is not spreading. Also, occasional interceptions of the Mediterranean recluse, Loxosceles rufescens are found in commercial goods shipped from out-of-state or from international cargo, but no populations of this spider are currently known in California and finds of them are still incredibly rare. Recluse spiders, as their name implies, are reclusive. They build webs as trigger systems to indicate that potential prey are walking nearby. They also use silk to build retreats in which to hide during the day. These nocturnal spiders emerge from their retreats at night and actively hunt down prey or may wait for prey to land in the small area several inches from their retreat. As dawn approaches, they may seek shelter in dark places such as in clothing or shoes, and mature males roam in search of females. It is these two behaviors that can bring them into contact with people. In nature, recluses are found in cracks and crevices in and under rocks or the loose bark of dead trees. Recluses have very much benefited from human-altered environments, where they are readily found under trash cans, plywood, tarps, rubber tires, and in storage boxes. They are synanthropic (found in association with humans) and therefore are considered \"house\" spiders. In fact in South America, the recluse species have common names that translate as \"the spider behind the picture\" or \"the spider in the corner.\" Recluse spiders are relatively long lived. Among the various species, they mature after about 1 year and average a 2- to 4-year life span with some living more than 7 years under laboratory conditions. They are also well known for surviving long periods (6 to 12 months) without food before perishing. Abundance of Recluses One consistent life history characteristic of recluse spiders is that in the right environment their populations are usually dense. If you find recluses, you do not find one, you find many. The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is a common house spider in the midwestern United States. Examples of the densities that the brown recluse can attain around human habitation include 9 under a piece of plywood in Oklahoma, 52 in an indoor laboratory, 6 under a waterbed frame in Arkansas, 40 collected in a Missouri barn in one hour, and 44 caught in sticky traps in a Tennessee home in one day. Eight Oklahoma 13-year-olds unknowingly hand-collected about 60 amongst bricks in about 7 minutes without getting bitten. In a 6-month study, a family in Kansas collected 2,055 brown recluse spiders in their 19th-century built home. They lived there nearly a decade, continued to find brown recluse spiders regularly, and only once in 10 years had anyone shown evidence of a bite; it was to a finger which turned red for a few days and then healed without incident. In fact, on many evenings, this family collected more brown recluse spiders per hour in their home than the entire California human population has ever been able to find in the state. Similarly, for the desert recluse in California, 12 of these spiders were collected under a doghouse in Yucca Valley and 6 were removed in one night from a small cottage bedroom in a Mojave Desert research facility. Absence of Brown Recluses in California Unlike many other spiders that disperse by either migrating or being carried by air currents when small (\"ballooning\"), recluse spiders usually only expand outside their native range as a result of human intervention. The few brown recluses that have been collected in California typically are found in facilities that receive goods from out of state or are unintentionally transported by people who have moved from the Midwest. In these instances, searching the immediate area yielded no additional brown recluses so they were considered to be individual stowaways. Undoubtedly, more brown recluses have been inadvertently brought into the state via commerce and the relocation of household belongings, especially during the Dust Bowl era, however amazingly few specimens have ever been collected. Translocated recluse spiders have never been able to establish a foothold and start a population in California. Considering that brown recluse spider bites are not common in the south-central Midwest where brown recluses frequently cohabit with people, it is clear that California does not have anywhere near sufficient populations of these spiders to be responsible for the number of bites that are attributed to them. RICE Therapy: The recommended treatment for most brown recluse bites (the ones that do not develop severe symptoms) is simple first aid: RICE therapy. R est I ce C ompression E levation',\n",
       "       'damage': 'All Loxosceles spiders tested so far have the venom component that is capable of causing necrotic skin lesions, so it is best to assume that all recluse spiders may be capable of causing skin damage. In general, the desert recluse spider\\'s venom is similar to that of the brown recluse and should be considered of equal potency. In comparison to the brown recluse spider, the Chilean recluse supposedly has more potent venom and the Mediterranean recluse\\'s venom has been said to be less potent. However, these comparisons are more anecdotal than quantitive assessments. About 10% of brown recluse bites cause moderate or greater tissue damage and scarring, but the vast majority only result in inflammation and heal well without medical intervention. Deaths have been reported in children, however these are extremely rare occurrences and can be prevented if accurately diagnosed and the proper medical treatment applied. Medical Misdiagnoses The problem of misdiagnosis is widespread in North America, including such unlikely places as Alaska and Canada where doctors have attributed skin lesions to recluse bites when no brown recluse spiders have ever been found north of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. One reason for the great awareness of the recluse spiders throughout North America is that necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds are commonly misdiagnosed as \"brown recluse bites.\" Although recluses can cause these types of wounds, the biological data involving the distribution of the spider indicate that most of these diagnoses are incorrect. A world-renowned toxicology physician who worked at University of Southern California Medical Center estimates that most general spider bites in California referred to him were actually the work of other arthropods, and that 60% of \"brown recluse spider bite\" diagnoses came from areas where no Loxosceles spiders were known to exist. This is a serious problem, in that several medical conditions misdiagnosed as recluse bites can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal consequences. Additionally, many people diagnosed as having brown recluse bites in California are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics work against bacteria and have no effect on spider venom. However, regardless of the causative agent, it is wise to seek medical attention if you feel that it is warranted. Because most brown recluse bites involve only inflammation, the recommended treatment is simple first aid: RICE therapy (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) although other medical experts suggest cold instead of ice (to avoid freezing tissue) and a neutral position (lay flat) rather than elevated. Multiple Lesions Spiders typically bite only once as a desperate defensive effort before they are crushed between flesh and some object. Therefore, spider bites are not the causes of skin lesions if 1) there are multiple lesions on one person at the same time, especially if the lesions are on widely separated parts of the body, 2) if there are multiple episodes of lesions on the same person over a period of several weeks or months, or 3) if there are multiple people in the same house or facility showing skin lesions at the same time. Multiple lesions immediately point toward the more likely situation of a contagious bacterial infection like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or possibly an infestation of an arthropod (fleas, mites, kissing bugs, bed bugs, etc.) that seeks out mammals for blood meals. Bacterial Infections Group A Streptococcus infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis, is sometimes misdiagnosed as a brown recluse bite, and has a fatality rate that can vary from 20 to 80% depending on how quickly it is correctly diagnosed. In serious cases, death from Strepococcus A can occur in a few days. Another medical condition that is frequently misdiagnosed as a spider bite or brown recluse bite is MRSA bacterial infection. Infections of this pathogen, which began to emerge in the 1990s, are no worse than other Staph infections. However, because they are not remedied by common antibiotics, the infections continue out of control and can be fatal unless properly medicated. In one national study involving 11 university-based medical facilities, 29% of the patients presenting for \"spider bite\" had MRSA as the cause of their skin and soft tissue injury. MRSA is a contagious infection, frequently found in places where people are housed in close quarters for lengthy periods of time. Such conditions include prisons and other correctional facilities, nursing homes, long-term health care facilities, sports camps, military barracks, and locker rooms and typically involve several people being afflicted simultaneously. Very often \"spider bites\" are the first thing that people blame as the cause of these wounds. However, more careful investigation typically leads to identifying a MRSA bacterial infection as the causal agent.The problem clears up quickly when the bacterial infection is correctly diagnosed and treated. Necrotic Wound Causes If you do get a necrotic wound in California, you and your medical professional should consider many other common causes to be much more probable than a bite from a brown recluse spider. If an arthropod is involved at all, one should first consider all those creatures that seek out mammals for blood meals and may cause necrotic-type wounds. These include mites, fleas, bed bugs, mosquitoes, soft ticks, hard ticks, and blood-sucking conenose bugs (also known as kissing bugs) (see Pest Notes : Fleas, Bed Bugs, Mosquitoes, Conenose Bugs, and Lyme Disease in California listed in SUGGESTED READING). In addition, there is a long list of medical conditions and diseases that exhibit necrotic-type wounds. A few of these are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial infections, lymphomatoid papulosis (a non-Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphoma), diabetic ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, infected herpes simplex, herpes zoster (\"shingles\"), chemical and thermal burns, poison ivy, poison oak, and Lyme disease. Any and all of these situations are more likely than the bite of a brown recluse spider in California.',\n",
       "       'management': 'If you do not live in the shaded areas on the map, you do not need to be concerned with recluse spiders in California. If you do live within the range of these spiders, you still need to verify that you have recluses on your property before attempting control. Not all micro-habitats within the shaded areas will be suitable for recluse survival. For example, even though Loxosceles laeta occurs in densely populated sections of Los Angeles, this species is usually found only in dark commercial and municipal storage basements, not in homes. This leaves the desert recluse as the only California species of concern, and a minor one at that. After verifying that you do have desert recluses in your home, there are steps you can take to reduce encounters with them. These measures are similar for reducing encounters with spiders in general. Nonchemical control The most important precaution is to remove or reduce outdoor trash and rubbish, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cansespecially if they are stored right next to the house. In residences with attached garages, block off house access to spiders by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites in self defense. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any bed skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under the bed. This minimizes the chance that any spider can crawl onto the bed and inflict a bite. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally used (gardening clothes and gloves, boots, baseball mitts, seasonal clothes and gear, etc.) should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags or bins, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Sticky traps placed along floor boards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. See the short UC IPM YouTube video How to Catch a Spider. Chemical control Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy and much less toxic for your living area to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify. Freeze the spider first, soak it in rubbing alcohol for a few days to preserve it, then pour off the alcohol and rinse the spider with water to remove alcohol residue before shipping. When sending the spider in for identification, do not mail it in alcohol as this is a violation of postal regulations.'},\n",

For some gardeners, this intensive management may include the application of pesticides to manage insects and mites. Other enthusiasts can maintain vigorous plants and produce high quality blooms with little or no use of insecticides. The keys to avoiding pest problems are careful selection of varieties (which vary significantly in susceptibility to insect and disease problems), good attention to appropriate cultural practices, and occasional handpicking or water sprays to remove pests. Regularly monitor for pests and keep an eye out for rising populations of the natural enemies that often rapidly reduce the numbers of aphids, mites, and other pests.

       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': \"Aphids. Aphids are the most common insect pests on roses. Species include the rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae, the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, and the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, among others. Aphids favor rapidly growing tissue such as buds and shoots. Low to moderate levels of aphids do little damage to plants, although some gardeners may be concerned by their very presence. Moderate to high populations can secrete copious amounts of honeydew, resulting in the growth of sooty mold, which blackens leaves. Very high numbers of aphids may distort or kill buds or reduce flower size. In most areas of California aphids are only considered a major problem for about 6 weeks in spring and early summer before high summer temperatures reduce their numbers. Aphids have many natural enemies including parasitic wasps, lady beetles, soldier beetles, and syrphid flies (see the section on Common Natural Enemies) that may rapidly reduce increasing populations. Ants protect aphids from natural enemies, so keeping them out of bushes with sticky barriers, baits, or traps may improve biological control. Lady beetles often increase in number when aphid populations are high. The convergent lady beetle is sold at nurseries for release against aphids and may provide limited control when properly released. For more information on how to release them see UC IPMs convergent lady beetle page in the Natural Enemies Gallery. Releasing green lacewings against the rose aphid has not been shown to offer significant control in research trials. A naturally occurring fungal disease may control aphids when conditions are wet or humid. In many landscape situations, knocking aphids off with a forceful stream or spray of water early in the day is all that is needed to supplement natural control. Insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils (including neem oil) can also be used to suppress aphids with only moderate impact on natural enemies. Soil-applied systemic insecticides, such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, are effective but are not usually necessary and may harm pollinators and natural enemies. Use of broadly toxic insecticides is not warranted in most gardens and landscapes. For more information on aphids see Pest Notes: Aphids . Insects and Mites that Cause Leaves to Stipple or Yellow Spider mites, including twospotted spider mite, Pacific spider mite, and strawberry spider mite, all in the genus Tetranychus, feed on foliage, causing leaves to become stippled or bleached, and may cause leaves to dry up and fall. Some species produce webbing while others do not. Spider mites are tiny (about the size of the period at the end of this sentence) and are best seen with a magnifier. Mites usually appear first on the undersides of leaves but may move to the upper surfaces as populations increase. High numbers are usually associated with dry, dusty conditions. Spider mite numbers may greatly increase if their many natural enemies are killed by broad-spectrum insecticides applied against other pests. For instance, applications of carbaryl or pyrethroid insecticides (such as cyfluthrin and permethrin) to control insect pests are frequently followed by an increase in mite populations. Conserving natural enemies, providing sufficient irrigation, and reducing dust may all help control mites. Overhead irrigation or periodic washing of leaves with water can be very effective in reducing mite numbers. If chemical treatment is necessary, spider mites can be controlled with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, and sprays should be targeted to ensure coverage of the undersides of the leaves. Although spider mites may be listed on many insecticide labels, most insecticides are not very effective against them and can actually trigger mite flare-ups as mentioned above. For more information about spider mites, see Pest Notes: Spider Mites . Rose leafhopper, Edwardsiana rosae, causes stippling damage that appears larger than mite stippling. Along with stippling, cast skins and the absence of webbing on the underside of leaves are good indications that leafhoppers are present. Leafhoppers are not common problems in most areas; be sure to check for the insects themselves if suspect stippling is observed. Plants can tolerate moderate stippling. Knock leafhoppers off with a water spray or use an insecticidal soap on nymphs if an infestation is severe. Insects that Distort or Discolor Blossoms Thrips. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, and madrone thrips, Thrips madroni, primarily cause injury to rose flowers, causing blossom petals to streak with brown or become distorted. Damage may be severe if flowers are attacked early at the bud stage. The tiny yellow or black thrips insects can be found within the blossoms. In August 2015, a new species of thrips, the chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis, was found infesting roses in southern California. This species, which is native to Asia and about the size of western flower thrips, can severely distort plant growth. This species may be found on leaves, leaf litter, on the axils of leaves, in curled leaves, and under the calyxes of flowers. Chilli thrips has a broad host range and, because of its habit of attacking leaves as well as flowers, has the potential to cause much more serious damage than other thrips species. Thrips problems are more likely to be severe where many rose plants grown close together provide a continuously blooming habitat. Fragrant, light-colored, and white roses are most often attacked and can be severely damaged. Cultivars with sepals that remain tightly wrapped around the bud until blooms open have fewer thrips problems. In most home garden and landscape situations, thrips can be tolerated. Frequent clipping and prompt disposal of spent blooms may reduce thrips problems. Control with insecticides is difficult because products are most effective on developing thrips, which usually feed deep within buds or flowers where pesticide applications cannot reach. It should be noted that western flower thrips can sometimes be considered beneficial because they are predators of spider mites. Insects that Chew Blossoms and/or Leaves Fuller rose beetle. Adults of Fuller rose beetle, Naupactus godmani, chew flowers and foliage leaving notched or ragged edges. Adult beetles are pale brown weevils that are about 3/8 inch long. They are flightless and hide during the day, often on the undersides of leaves. Feeding takes place at night. The larvae are root feeders but do not seriously damage roses. Low numbers can be ignored. Otherwise, handpick the beetles off plants, use sticky material on stems to trap and exclude them, and trim any branches touching walls, fences, or other plants. In California, adults emerge from June to November and are difficult to control with insecticides. Parasitic nematodes, which attack larvae, may be helpful if applied to the soil in early to midsummer. Hoplia beetle, Hoplia callipyge, is about 1/4 inch long and chews holes mostly in the petals of open flowers. It is primarily a problem in the Central Valley from Sacramento south to Bakersfield. The hoplia beetle prefers feeding on flowers of light-colored roses (white, pink, apricot, and yellow) and does not damage leaves. Larvae are root feeders but do not feed on the roots of rose plants. There is only one generation a year and damage is usually confined to the 2- to 4-week period in late spring when adults are active. Adult hoplia beetles can be handpicked or infested rose blooms removed. Insecticide sprays are not very effective and should not be necessary in a garden situation. For more information about hoplia beetle, see Pest Notes: Hoplia Beetle . Hoplia beetles may be mistaken for Japanese beetles, Popillia japonica, serious pests in other areas of the United States, but Japanese beetles are about twice as long and are metallic green with coppery wing covers. Japanese beetles are not established in California. If you believe you have found a Japanese beetle in your landscape, contact the California Department of Food and Agriculture Hotline (1-800-491-1899; also see cdfa.ca.gov/plant/JB/). Leafcutting bees, Megachile spp., cut semicircular holes in the margins of leaves and carry leaf material back to use in lining their nests. Bees are important pollinators and should not be killed. There are no effective controls. Rose curculio, Merhynchites bicolor ., is a reddish-black snout weevil about 1/4 inch long that prefers yellow and white roses. Adults feed by drilling holes in flower buds that may kill the developing bud or result in ragged holes in blossoms when they open. If weevils are numerous, terminal shoots may be killed as well. Eggs are laid inside buds and larvae feed within, often killing buds before they open. When mature, larvae drop to the ground to overwinter and pupate in the soil, emerging as adults in spring. There is only one generation a year. Hand pick adults off plants and destroy buds infested with larvae. Many beetles may be removed from heavily infested bushes by gently shaking plants over a bucket of soapy water. A broad-spectrum insecticide can be applied to kill adults if the infestation is severe. Caterpillars such as orange tortrix, tussock moth, fruittree leafroller, tent caterpillar, and omnivorous looper may feed on rose leaves, flowers and buds . Some of these caterpillars may also tie leaves together with silk. Some caterpillars, like the tobacco budworm, may bore into flower buds. Look for the caterpillar or its frass inside. Hand pick caterpillars or prune out and promptly dispose of infested buds or rolled leaves (often hiding caterpillars within). Damage is usually not severe and treatment with pesticides not generally necessary. Leaf-feeding caterpillars can be reduced with the microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis or the insecticide spinosad. These materials will be most effective when caterpillars are small, and caterpillars within buds are unlikely to be killed. Damage may not be noticed until after caterpillars are full grown and no longer vulnerable to insecticide applications. Roseslugs include several species of sawflies that damage leaves on roses. Sawflies are wasps with plant-feeding larvae that resemble caterpillars. Young larvae skeletonize lower leaf surfaces while mature larvae chew large holes in leaves. Roseslugs have many natural enemies that help keep their populations down. They may be washed off plants with strong streams of water or killed with insecticidal soap, horticultural oil, or spinosad. Insecticides containing Bacillus thuringiensis are not effective against roseslugs because they are not the larvae of butterflies or moths. Insects that Cause Canes to Die Back Flatheaded borers, Chrysobothris spp., may kill canes or entire plants. Larvae are white and up to 1 inch long with enlarged heads. Adult beetles do not significantly damage roses. Eggs tend to be laid on stressed rose plants, especially in bark wounds caused by sunburn or disease. Remove and destroy infested plant material and keep plants healthy by providing sufficient irrigation and avoiding excessive summer pruning. Raspberry horntail larvae, Hartigia cressoni, are white, segmented larvae up to 1 inch long that feed within rose stems or canes. Adults are black or black and yellow wood wasps about 1/2 inch long. In the spring, horntail feeding can cause tips of canes to wilt and die, reducing second-cycle rose blooms. Inspect canes in spring (mid-April to mid-June) for egg-laying incisions or swellings caused by larvae feeding within and cut them off below the infestation. Prune down infested canes until a healthy cross section is found. Scale insects that may attack roses include two species of armored scales: the rose scale, Aulacaspis rosae, and the San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus . These pests may cause cane decline or dieback when numbers are high. San Jose scale may spread by wind from nearby orchards, and so may be found on roses near urban-agricultural interfaces in California's Central Valley and other fruit or nut tree production areas. Armored scales can be observed on canes as small, grayish, round to oval encrustations, ranging in size from 1/8 to 1/4 inch. These insects have no legs or antennae for most of their lives and are immobile. In winter, cut back and destroy infested canes and apply insecticidal oil to any remaining infested canes if the scale population is high. Scales are attacked by many natural enemies. Look for exit holes in mature scale covers, indicating parasitization. Other scale insects, including cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi, and several species of soft scales such as black scale, Saissetia oleae, may also be found on roses. These insects produce honeydew, which may cause leaves to be sticky and will allow black sooty mold to colonize leaf surfaces. Washing plants with soap and water may reduce populations. Pruning and application of horticultural oil in winter for armored scales should provide sufficient control. For more information about scale insects, see Pest Notes: Scales . Insects Seldom Found in California Roses Mossy rose galls, created by the gall wasp Diplolepis rosae, are spherical spined masses of plant tissue about an inch in diameter that form on year-old rose twigs. At first, the deformity resembles moss, but it becomes hardened as it enlarges. Although mossy rose gall is most common, many kinds of galls can form on roses; most caused by different gall wasp species. They may occur on twigs, stems or leaves and have various shapes and textures. Galls are more common in cooler, northern parts of California than in the Central Valley. They are generally not damaging and pruning them out should provide sufficient control. Rose midge, Dasineura rhodophaga, was found infesting roses in a nursery in Petaluma, California, in August 1996; however, it has not been reported in California since. This pest can cause severe damage and is established in Oregon, Washington, and other states, so rose growers should be on the lookout for new infestations, especially when purchasing new plants. Rose midges are tiny flies that lay their eggs inside the sepals of flower buds or on plant terminals. Hatching larvae move into flower buds to feed, leaving the injured buds to wither, blacken, and die. Pupation occurs in the soil and 2 to 4 generations can occur annually. Take any suspected infested material to your county Agricultural Commissioner for identification. Don't confuse the rose midge with the similar looking beneficial midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza, which feeds on aphids. Aphidoletes larvae are found on stem, bud, or leaf surfaces feeding within aphid colonies, whereas Dasineura larvae will be hidden out of view at the bases of developing buds. COMMON NATURAL ENEMIES Aphid parasites. Tiny parasitic wasps are very important in the control of aphids on roses. Adults lay their eggs within the aphid and developing wasp larvae feeding within rapidly immobilize the aphids. Eventually, the parasites kill the aphids and turn them into bronze or black crusty, bloated mummies. The parasitic wasp larva pupates within the mummy and then cuts a neat, round hole and emerges as a full-grown wasp . Once you see one mummy in the aphid colony, you are likely to see more. Parasitic wasps are also important in the control of scale insects, caterpillars, and many other insect pests. Minute pirate bug. Minute pirate bugs, Orius tristicolor, are tiny true bugs with black and white markings as adults. They are often among the first predators to appear in spring, and they feed on mites, insect and mite eggs, immature scales, and thrips. Lacewings. Green lacewings in the genera Chrysopa and Chrysoperla are common natural enemies of aphids and other soft-bodied insects. The gray-green to brown alligator-shaped larvae are the predatory stage. The green lacy-winged adults feed on honeydew. Lady beetles. Many different red and black lady beetle species are predators of aphids; the most common is the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens . Another common species in the garden is the Asian multicolored lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis . These lady beetles feed primarily on aphids and are predators in both the adult and larval stages. Look for the black, alligator-shaped larvae with orange dots and oblong, yellow lady beetle eggs that are laid on end in groups. Releases of commercially available convergent lady beetles can reduce aphid numbers. However, large numbers must be released on each individual rose plant. Mist lady beetles with a water spray before release. Make releases in the evening at dusk by placing beetles on canes at the base of plants. Wet plants first with a fine spray of water. Expect 90% of the lady beetles to fly away in the first 24 hours. The remaining lady beetles are unlikely to lay eggs and will fly away once aphid populations have been substantially reduced. Leatherwings or soldier beetles . These moderate to large-sized beetles in the cantharid family have leatherlike dark wings and orange or red heads and thoraxes. Several species feed on aphids and are very common on roses. Many people mistake soldier beetles for pests, but they can be important predators. Sometimes the beetles, which may feed on pollen and nectar as well as aphids, leave dark splotches of excrement on leaves. Soldier beetle larvae are also predaceous but live in the soil, feeding on soil-dwelling invertebrates. Syrphid flies. In their larval stage, syrphids, sometimes called flower flies or hover flies, are important predators of aphids and are very common on roses. Syrphid adults superficially resemble honey bees or wasps, feed on nectar and pollen before reproducing, and are often seen hovering above flowers. There are many species of hover flies in California. The aphid-feeding larvae, often found within aphid colonies, are legless and maggot-shaped and vary in color from dull brown or yellow to bright green; some species have a stripe down their backs. Don't mistake them for moth or butterfly caterpillars, which have legs and chew holes in leaves. Predaceous mites. A number of predatory mites feed on spider mites, often keeping them at tolerable levels. Predatory mites can be distinguished from the plant-feeding spider mites by the absence of the two spots on either side of the body, their pear shape, and their more active habits. Compared to the plant-feeding species of mites, which remain in one location feeding, predatory mites move rapidly around the leaf when looking for prey. Because they are so small, a hand lens is helpful in viewing them. Thrips . Sixspotted thrips, Eotetranychus sexmaculatus, feeds on spider mites. Western flower thrips are plant feeders but also feed on spider mites. While thrips damage may not be tolerated within commercial production, in landscape settings thrips may provide benefits outweighing the limited damage they cause. Spiders. All spiders are predators and many contribute significantly to biological control. Many types of spiders including crab spiders, jumping spiders, cobweb spiders, and orbweavers occur in landscapes.\",\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Spiders are mostly beneficial because they feed on pest insects. However, many people think that all spiders are dangerous and aggressive. In California, the main spider capable of causing serious injury is the black widow, which generally remains outdoors and out of sight. Spiders seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people. Focus pest management efforts on removing webs and hiding places. Pesticides are not generally recommended. What to know about spiders: The jaws of most spiders are too small to bite humans. Adult female black widows are the main spiders capable of seriously injuring people in California. They are shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the underside and are commonly found outdoors, in sheltered, dry, undisturbed areas such as wood piles and garages. Anyone bitten by a black widow spider should remain calm and seek medical advice. The brown recluse spider and the hobo spider do not live in California. Some other spiders bite when trapped in clothing or bedding, but the effect is usually no more severe than itching or the reaction to a bee sting. To prevent spiders from entering your house, take these steps: Seal home foundation cracks and other access holes. Inspect window and door screens for good seals to keep out spiders and the insects they prey on. Keep areas around home foundations free of clutter. Manage spiders using these tips: Indoors, regular housecleaning provides adequate spider control. Vacuum up the spider and its web. Alternatively, squash spiders or capture them in a jar and release them outside. Prevent clutter buildup that can provide spider hiding places both indoors and out. Remove spider webs from the exterior of the house with a broom or high pressure hose. Spiders and biological control: When removing spiders, dont overlook the fact that spiders eat a large number and variety of nuisance and pest insects. Spiders also have natural enemieswasps, other spiders, birds, reptiles, and othersthat sometimes keep them from becoming too numerous.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'In the mid-1990s, Zoropsis spinimana, a large spider from the Mediterranean region, started showing up in homes around the San Francisco Bay area. It has since become well established around the southern, eastern, and northern portions of the Bay and has become a permanent member of the California spider population. Although the known distribution is not very extensive, this spider does inhabit a part of the state that is densely populated by humans and Zoropsis is routinely found in homes, causing concern among the people who encounter it. However, it is harmless to people. This Pest Note was prepared to provide information regarding this non-native resident. The first California reports of Zoropsis spinimana were from the Sunnyvale area in Santa Clara County in 1992. Since then the spider has mostly spread north and east around the San Francisco Bay area with specimens found throughout Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, Marin, and Santa Cruz Counties. Scientists at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco are tracking the spiders spread. So far, Zoropsis spinimana seems to be found only in and around human dwellings. However, it is also possible that this spider is establishing itself in natural vegetation areas.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'Mature adults of Zoropsis spinimana are long-legged spiders about 1/2 to 5/8 inch in body length and with a leg span of 1 to 1 1/4 inches. Females have slightly larger bodies and shorter legs than males. For the most part, the Zoropsis spider is a typical brown spider of varying shades of brown mixed with little black markings over most of its body. In many respects, it resembles a wolf spider. One distinctive mark is a longitudinal, black mark with several outward flares on the central top surface of the abdomen, near the cephalothorax (the part of the spider to which the legs attach). Be aware that there are some species of wolf spiders that also have a black mark in this area; but most often, the wolf spider mark is diamond-shaped with only one flare at the center. Zoropsis spiders also differ from wolf spiders in the eye arrangement. Zoropsis eyes are restricted to the front edge of the cephalothorax; in wolf spiders the eyes are spread across the front third of the cephalothorax. Zoropsis spinimana can be distinguished from other common household spiders by these features: its abdomen is elongate (never globular) and it is never found in orb webs hanging between trees or on porches. Zoropsis spinimana is a hunting spider (like wolf spiders), meaning it does not spin a web or use silk to subdue prey. Its silk is used primarily by the female to cover her egg sac. Like other spiders, its diet is primarily insects. Little information is available about the biology of this spider. Most specimens that have been submitted for identification are mature males and females; this means that people are finding wandering spiders that are searching for mates or roaming in search of food or for other reasons. Mature specimens have been found from September to May and are commonly encountered throughout the winter. It is not known where the immature spiders spend the summers or if this spider requires more than one season to mature. Despite the fact that this spider is large enough to be intimidating, Zoropsis spinimana is harmless. No spider in this genus is known to be medically important and there are no verified accounts of bites by this spider causing any significant medical problems.',\n",

       "       'development': 'Spiders resemble insects and sometimes are confused with them, but they are arachnids, not insects. Spiders have eight legs and two body partsa head region (cephalothorax) and an abdomen. They lack wings and antennae. Although spiders often are found on plants, they eat mainly insects, other spiders, and related arthropods, not plants. Most spiders have toxic venom, which they use to kill their prey. However, only those spiders whose venom typically causes a serious reaction in humans are called poisonous spiders. See the sidebar: Spider Bites. Table 1. Common Spider Families in North America. Agelenidae, funnel weavers or grass spiders Sit-and-wait predators feed during the day and night on the ground in most types of vegetation, including low-growing plants and trees. Spin funnel-shaped webs, often with several-inch-wide, flat extension covering plants or soil. The spider waits in the hole of its web. When it detects vibrations from an insect that flew or walked into the web, the spider runs out, captures and bites the prey, then carries it back into the funnel to be eaten. Webs on low vegetation become conspicuous in morning light after collecting dew. Funnel weavers have six or eight eyes, all about the same size, arranged in two rows. About 300 species in North America. Araneidae, orb weavers or garden spiders Feed on insects that fly, fall, or are blown into web. Elaborate silken webs are spun in concentric circles. Spiderlings often make symmetrical webs; mature spiders may spin a more specialized design that is helpful in identifying certain species. The spider rests at the center of its web or hides in a shelter near the edge, waiting for prey to become entangled. Orb weavers generally have poor vision and rely on web vibrations to locate and identify prey. About 200 species in North America. Clubionidae (including Corinnidae), sac spiders or twoclawed hunting spiders Stalk and capture prey that is walking or resting on surfaces. They spin silken tubes or sacs under bark, among leaves, and in low plants or on the ground, where they hide during the day or retreat after hunting. Commonly are nocturnal, medium-sized, pale spiders with few markings. About 200 species in North America. Linyphiidae (=Microphantidae), dwarf spiders Prey on insects that fall, walk, or land in their web. Diurnal (day active) spiders occurring in the plant canopy and among litter on the ground. They produce sheetlike webs on the surface of plants or soil and are common in some field and vegetable crops. Most are relatively small. Several hundred species in North America. Lycosidae, wolf spiders Prey on insects that are walking or resting on the ground. Actively hunt in the open during the day and night, often observed on the ground in litter and on low vegetation. Can occur in burrows and under debris on soil. Instead of spinning webs to catch prey, make a small, thick web where they rest. Have a distinctive pattern of eyes: four small eyes in front in a straight row, one middle pair of larger eyes, and one rear pair of widely spaced eyes on top of the head. They have long hairy legs. They are usually black and white or strongly contrasting light and dark, which can make them difficult to discern unless they are moving. About 200 species in North America. Oxyopidae, lynx spiders Stalk and capture resting or walking insects. Active hunters with good vision. Most have spiny legs and a brightly colored body that tapers sharply toward the rear. They have four pairs of eyes grouped in a hexagon. About 2 dozen known species in North America. Salticidae, jumping spiders Day-active hunters in plants or on the ground. They make no web; instead they stalk and pounce on prey by jumping distances many times their body length. Jumping spiders have a distinctive pattern of eyes in three rows: the first row of four eyes, with large and distinctive middle eyes; a second row of two very small to minute eyes; and a third row of two medium sized eyes. They usually have an iridescent, metallic-colored abdomen and black carapace. About 300 species in North America. Theridiidae, cobweb, cobweb weaver, or combfooted spiders Feed on insects that walk or fly into their webs. Almost always found hanging upside down by their claws in irregularly spun, sticky webs, waiting for prey. The spider is usually concealed in a corner of the web, in a silken tent, or behind debris. This group includes the black widow spider, which produces relatively thick silk that feels rough and sticky. They generally have a soft, round, bulbous abdomen and slender legs without spines. Over 200 species in North America. Thomisidae, crab spiders or flower spiders Stalk and capture insects walking or resting on surfaces. Diurnal hunters that do not spin webs. Front two pairs of legs are enlarged and extend beyond the side of their flattened body, making them look like tiny crabs. Their small eyes occur in two slightly curved rows, with the top row often much wider than the lower row. Over 200 species in North America. Black Widow Spider The black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most common harmful spider in California. Venom from its bite can cause reactions ranging from mild to painful and serious, but death is very unlikely and many symptoms can be alleviated if medical treatment is obtained. Anyone bitten by this spider should remain calm and promptly seek medical advice; it is helpful if the offending spider can be caught and saved for identification. The typical adult female black widow has a shiny black body, slender black legs, and a red or orange mark in the shape of an hourglass on the underside of the large, round abdomen. The body, excluding legs, is 5/16 to 5/8 inch long. Only the larger immature female and adult female spiders are able to bite through a persons skin and inject enough venom to cause a painful reaction. The adult male black widow is one-half to two-thirds the length of the female, has a small abdomen, and is seldom noticed. The male black widow does possess venom, but its fangs are too small to break human skin. The top side of its abdomen is olive-greenish gray with a pattern of cream-colored areas and one light-colored band going lengthwise down the middle. The hourglass mark on the underside of the abdomen typically is yellow or yellow-orange and broad waisted. The legs are banded with alternating light and dark areas. Contrary to popular belief, the female black widow rarely eats the male after mating but may do so if hungry. Like males, young female black widow spiders are patterned on the top side. In the early stages they greatly resemble males but gradually acquire the typical female coloration with each shedding of the skin. In intermediate stages they have tan or cream-colored, olive-gray, and orange markings on the top side of the abdomen, a yellowish orange hourglass mark on the underside, and banded legs. Webs and Egg Sacs The web of the black widow is an irregular, tough-stranded, sticky cobweb mesh in which the spider hangs with its underside up. During the day it often hides under an object at the edge of the web or stays in a silken retreat in the center. The black widow may rush out of its hiding place when the web is disturbed, especially if egg sacs are present. The egg sacs are mostly spherical, about 1/2 inch long and 5/8 inch in diameter, creamy yellow to light tan in color, opaque, and tough and paperlike on the surface. A female may produce several egg sacs. Tiny, young black widows, which are nearly white in color, disperse to new locations by ballooning and infest new areas. Spider Bites Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-222-1222). Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, apply an antiseptic to prevent infection, and use ice or ice water to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary, try to relieve the itch with medication. Scratching can break the skin and introduce bacterial infection, which you or even a physician may mistake for an arachnid bite. If you receive a bite that causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician. If you catch the critter in the act, save it for identification, preserve it (or whatever parts of it remain), and take it to your county UC Cooperative Extension office. If no one there can identify it, ask that it be forwarded to a qualified arachnologist. Where the Spiders Live. Black widow spiders occur in most parts of California. They and their associated webs usually are found in dark, dry, sheltered, relatively undisturbed places such as among piles of wood, rubbish, or stones; in culverts, hollow stumps, and old animal burrows; in garages, sheds, barns, crawl spaces, utility meter boxes, and outhouses; and sometimes among plants. People are most likely to be bitten when they disturb the spider while they are cleaning out or picking up items in such places. A sensible precaution is to always wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt when working in areas that have been undisturbed for a time and where there are good hiding places for spiders. Effects of the Bite. The symptoms of a black widow bite are largely internal; little more than local redness and swelling may develop at the bite site. The internal effects may range from mild to severe. Pain tends to spread from the bite to other parts of the body and muscular spasms may develop. In severe cases the abdominal muscles may become quite rigid. Other effects can include profuse sweating, fever, increased blood pressure, difficulty breathing and speaking, restlessness, and nausea. Typically, the pain and other symptoms reach a maximum within a day of the bite, then gradually subside over the next 2 to 3 days. Most people who are bitten spend a few hours under observation by a physician but do not develop symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Small children, the elderly, and persons with health problems are likely to suffer some of the more severe consequences of the bite. Black widow bites are fairly common in California. Yellow Sac Spider The common, house-dwelling agrarian sac or yellow sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum, is a small spider that spins a silken sac web in the corners of ceilings and walls, and behind shelves and pictures; it is also commonly found outdoors in shrubbery. This spider is light yellow and has a slightly darker stripe on the upper middle of the abdomen. The eight eyes of this spider are all about equal in size and arranged in two horizontal rows. Yellow sac spiders can be seen running on walls and ceilings at night and quickly drop to the floor to escape if they are disturbed. Bites usually occur when the spider becomes trapped against a persons skin in clothing or bedding. It is estimated that sac spiders are responsible for more bites on people than any other spider. Typical symptoms of a bite include initial pain, redness, and sometimes swelling. Recluse Spiders Recluse spiders of the genus Loxosceles include the well-known brown recluse spider, L. reclusa, which does not occur in California. While the brown recluse has occasionally been brought into California in household furnishings, firewood, and motor vehicles, it does not reside in the state. However, populations of another recluse spider, the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta), were found in Los Angeles County in the late 1960s. In its native Chile it is known to have a bite that is toxic to humans. The native recluse spider of California (L. deserta) is found in the desert regions of southern California and neighboring states. Its bite can cause problems, but it is not as toxic as that of the Chilean recluse. In any case, bites from the desert recluse are rare and no bites from the Chilean recluse have ever been recorded in California despite its presence in heavily populated urban areas. Both the native desert recluse spider and the Chilean recluse spider occur principally in the drier areas of southern California. Recluse spiders can have a violin-shaped mark (with the neck of the violin pointing backward) on the top side of the head region (cephalothorax). However, the mark is not always distinct, so it should not be used as an identifying character. A unique feature of recluse spiders is their six eyes, arranged in pairs in a semicircle, which can be seen with the use of a good hand lens. Most other spiders have eight eyes. All recluse spiders make large, irregular, flattened, cobweb-type webs with thick strands extending in all directions. These spiders avoid light, are active at night, and tend to build their webs in out-of-the-way places. Chilean recluse spiders may be found indoors in boxes, in corners, behind pictures, in old clothing hanging undisturbed, and in other similar places. Desert recluse spiders appear outdoors where they may be found under rocks or wood. More detailed information on these spiders is available in Pest Notes: Brown Recluse and Other Recluse Spiders . Other Spiders In addition to the species mentioned above, there are only a few other species of spiders in California that may on occasion bite humans. (Remember, if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, contact a physician). One kind of red and black jumping spider, Phidippus johnsoni, may bite if it is disturbed, but the bites are usually not serious. The female spiders are black with red on the top side of the abdomen whereas the males are all red. These spiders range in size from 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Tarantulas are long-lived spiders that occupy burrows in the ground during the day but often come out at night to hunt insects near the burrow. They commonly are feared because of their large size and hairy appearance. Some poisonous tarantulas occur in tropical parts of the world, but the bites of California tarantulas are not likely to be seriousat worst, they are similar to a bee sting. However, because of the variety of tarantulas sold in the pet trade industry, there is a spectrum of venom potencies among these creatures. These spiders ranges from 1 to 2 inches in body size. The hobo spider, Tegenaria agrestis, also called the aggressive house spider, is a common spider in the Pacific Northwest. It builds funnel-shaped webs in dark, moist areas such as basements, window wells, wood piles, and around the perimeter of homes. It is a large (1 to 13/4 inch, including legs), fast-running brown spider with a herringbone or multiple chevron pattern on the top of the abdomen. The hobo spider has not been documented in California, but it has expanded its range from the Pacific Northwest to northern Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Although it has been stated as being a poisonous spider, recent research is challenging the original data that elevated this spider to medical importance. See Pest Notes: Hobo Spiders . One spider frequently found indoors is the common house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, which makes a cobweb in corners of rooms, in windows, and in similar places. Another is the marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, which was introduced into the state in the 1970s and has since displaced the once common longbodied cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides, a long-legged spider that resembles a daddy-longlegs. These spiders are only marginally capable of biting humans because their fangs are too short to pierce peoples skin; they primarily cause problems by producing messy cobwebs. Various kinds of small hunting spiders may wander indoors and occasionally, rather large, hunting-type spiders are discovered in homes or garages. Often these are fully grown wolf spider or tarantula males that have reached maturity and are searching for females. When these spiders are wandering, one or more may accidentally get indoors. New houses and other structures in developments may be invaded by wolf spiders that have lost their usual outdoor living places. The more insects that exist inside a building, the more likely it is to have spiders living there. Usually spiders are most abundant in fall following the first few rains of the season. Immature and adult female burrow-living spiders sometimes wander for a time during the rainy season if they have had to abandon wet burrows.',\n",

       "       'management': 'Spiders may enter houses and other structures through cracks and other openings. They also may be carried in on items like plants, firewood, and boxes. To prevent spiders from coming indoors, seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors. Good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they prey upon. Regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, basements, and other seldom used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive the tumbling process through the hose. Indoors, a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider because occupied spider webs are maintained for cleanliness to enhance prey capture. Individual spiders can also be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. They can then be released outdoors. Watch this video to learn more: How to catch a spider. In indoor storage areas, place boxes off the floor and away from walls, whenever possible, to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders. Sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within. Clean up clutter in garages, sheds, basements, and other storage areas. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Outdoors, eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash, leaf litter, heavy vegetation, and other accumulations of materials. Trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attracts spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Chemical Control: Insecticides will not provide long-term control and should not generally be used against spiders outdoors. Typically, controlling spiders with pesticides is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control, including pyrethrins and pyrethroids (synthetic versions of pyrethrins) such as resmethrin, allethrin, or combinations of these products. Control by spraying is only temporary unless accompanied by housekeeping. It is just as easy and much less toxic to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe or to vacuum it up. Sticky traps offer a noninsecticidal way to remove spiders from your home as long as you can place the traps where pets and children cant tamper with them. Sorptive dusts containing amorphous silica gel (silica aerogel) and pyrethrins, which can be applied by professional pest control applicators only, may be useful in certain indoor situations. Sorptive dust particles affect the outer covering of spiders (and also insects) that have crawled over a treated surface, causing them to dry out and die. When applied as a dustlike film and left in place, a sorptive dust provides permanent protection against spiders. The dust is most safely and effectively used in cracks and crevices and in attics, wall voids, and other enclosed or unused places. SPIDER BITES: Unlike mosquitoes, spiders do not seek people in order to bite them. Generally, a spider doesnt try to bite a person unless it has been squeezed, lain on, or similarly provoked to defend itself. Moreover, the jaws of most spiders are so small that the fangs cannot penetrate the skin of an adult person. Sometimes when a spider is disturbed in its web, it may bite instinctively because it mistakenly senses that an insect has been caught. The severity of a spider bite depends on factors such as the kind of spider, the amount of venom injected, and the age and health of the person bitten. A spider bite might cause no reaction at all, or it might result in varying amounts of itching, redness, stiffness, swelling, and painat worst, usually no more severe than a bee sting. Typically, the symptoms persist from a few minutes to a few hours. Like reactions to bee stings, however, people vary in their responses to spider bites, so if the bite of any spider causes an unusual or severe reaction, such as increasing pain or extreme swelling, contact a physician, hospital, or poison control center (in California, the number is 1-800-876-4766 or 1-800-8-POISON). One must also keep in mind that although it is impossible to be certain, people and their physicians often blame spiders as the cause of skin lesions with no proof of spider involvement when there are many similar-appearing, non-spider maladies; therefore, care must be exerted in the diagnostic process. Sometimes a person may not be aware of having been bitten until pain and other symptoms begin to develop. Other species of arthropods whose bites or stings may be mistaken for that of a spider include ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, bedbugs, mosquitoes, the conenose (kissing) bug (Triatoma protracta), deer flies, horse flies, and water bugs (Lethocerus spp.). For first aid treatment of a spider bite, wash the bite, and use ice, ice water or cold compresses to reduce swelling and discomfort. Bites or stings from a variety of arthropods can result in an itching wound. Rather than scratching, if necessary try to relieve the itch with medication.

       "      'body': {'description': 'Contrary to popular belief, there are no populations of the brown recluse, Loxosceles reclusa, in California. In fact, fewer than 20 verified specimens have been collected in the state over several decades by spider experts. Yet people in California frequently relate stories in which they or someone they know was supposedly bitten or they have had a physician diagnose them with a brown recluse spider bite. Black widows on the other hand, are very common throughout the state, causing potentially serious injury with their bite. The adult females are easily identifiable by their shiny black body color and red hourglass on the belly. For information on black widows, see the Pest Notes: Widow Spiders and Their Relatives. Although the brown recluse does not live in California, four species of native recluse spiders occur in southern areas of the state and can cause similar medical concerns. The most common Californian recluse spider is the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta . It is found mostly in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, in the foothills of the lower San Joaquin Valley, and in adjacent areas of Mexico; most of these areas are sparsely populated by humans. This publication was written to provide science-based information about the status of the brown recluse and other related spiders in California. COMMON AND SCIENTIFIC NAMES Over the years, the group of spiders to which the brown recluse belongs has been known by various colloquial names: \"violin\" spiders, \"fiddleback\" spiders, \"recluse\" spiders, and \"brown\" spiders. The recluse spiders are in the family Sicariidae (formerly Loxoscelidae). The scientific name for the recluse spider genus is Loxosceles (lox-SOS-a-leez) and rhymes somewhat with \"isosceles\" as in the triangle. Whereas \"isosceles\" means equal legs, \"loxosceles\" means slanted legs, referring to the way the recluse spiders hold their legs at rest. All known members of the group have scientific names, and the more familiar members of this group also have common names (e.g., brown recluse, desert recluse, Arizona recluse).',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'The most definitive physical feature of recluse spiders is their eyes : most spiders have 8 eyes that typically are arranged in 2 rows of 4, but recluse spiders have 6 equal-sized eyes arranged in 3 pairs, each pair called dyads. There is a dyad at the front of the cephalothorax (the first main body part to which the legs attach) and another dyad on each side further back with a space separating the dyads from one another. Many publications refer to the \"violin\" marking on the dorsal (top) surface of the cephalothorax (head region) as the most important diagnostic feature. Although this marking is fairly consistent in mature brown recluses and Texan recluses (Loxosceles devia), it can vary in intensity, sometimes fading on preserved specimens, and it is very faint to nonexistent in several recluse species found in the southwestern United States (e.g., the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta). Therefore, checking the eye pattern is the best way to eliminate almost all suspect non-recluse spiders from consideration, whereas the presence or absence of the violin marking may lead to misidentifications. Non-arachnologists (including physicians, pest control operators, and even some entomologists) have envisioned \"violins\" on various body surfaces of harmless spiders and incorrectly assume that they have properly identified a brown recluse spider. In addition, the abdomens of all North American recluses are covered with fine hairs and are uniformly colored (not patterned), although the coloration can vary from light beige to dark brown, depending in part on what they have eaten recently. There is never a color pattern on the abdomen of North American specimens. Finally, the uniformly colored legs are similarly covered with fine hairs whereas many non-recluse spiders have stout spines and a pattern of stripes, rings, or spots on their legs. Some other spiders share one or more of these physical characteristics. However, to be identified as a recluse spider, it must have all 5 of these characteristics. six eyes in dyads (pairs) uniformly colored abdomen with fine hairs no spines on the legs uniformly colored legs body not more than 3/8\" in length On this basis, more than 99% of the spiders found by Californians can be identified as something other than a recluse spider. In the unlikely event that one does find a recluse spider in California, it will most likely be the native desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta. To identify Loxosceles spiders to species level requires a high-magnification microscope and the skills of a spider expert (arachnologist). SPIDERS COMMONLY CONFUSED WITH RECLUSES Because of the misinformation surrounding the brown recluse\\'s presence in California, many spiders that are virtually harmless are submitted by the public to arachnologists for identification. Most of them are not from the recluse family and some are not even spiders. A nationwide study was undertaken from 2000 to 2005, offering to identify any spider that was considered to be a brown recluse spider. Nearly 600 specimens were submitted from California, many from people who were adamant that they had a brown recluse. Only one of these specimens was a brown recluse, from a house where the family had moved from Missouri, a state that is well-known to have abundant brown recluse populations. No additional recluses were found in the house. The occasional finding of a translocated brown recluse spider is not surprising; however, it still is extremely rare. There were 17 desert recluse spiders submitted in this study, all from the desert regions of southeastern California where the spiders are known to occur. Non-recluse spiders were submitted in great numbers including many false black widows, woodlouse, and yellow sac spiders. Presented below are descriptions of spiders that share some of the same physical features as the brown recluse and have been misidentified as recluse spiders. For additional information on these spiders, consult a spider identification book such as Common Spiders of North America by Richard Bradley, listed in the References section or the table of common spider families found in California, located in the Pest Notes: Spiders . Six-Eyed Spiders Spitting spiders (Scytodes spp.) are closely related to recluse spiders and have 6 eyes arranged in a similar pattern. However, unlike recluse spiders, they also have many black spots or lines on their bodies and a strongly domed cephalothorax. The woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata, has 6 eyes arranged in 2 groups of 3 (triads) and no bodily markings. Spiders with Violin-Shaped or Other Dark Markings Many common tan or gray spiders have dark markings on the head region, which convinces people that they have caught a true recluse spider. These spiders include cellar spiders (Pholcus phalangioides, Psilochorus spp., Physocyclus spp.), pirate spiders (Mimetus spp.), and sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae family). The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, also confuses people even though the dark marks are on the ventral (underside) not the dorsal (top) surface of the body. The most common submissions as brown recluses are spiders in the genus Titiotus . These spiders are found just north of Los Angeles, through central California to Redding and are common in forests. Titiotus spiders have a hair pattern that gives the impression of a violin and its coloration is similar to that of a brown recluse. Another frequent submission is Zoropsis spinimana, which is found in the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento. It is a harmless Mediterranean immigrant species, first detected in California around 1995. It is large and frequently captured in homes. Residents see the dark marking on the top surface of the abdomen as a violin, but recluses have this type of marking on their cephalothorax. See the Pest Notes: Zoropsis spinimana, A Mediterranean Spider in California for more information. Ubiquitous Brown Spiders Virtually every spider that is tan or brown has been turned in by Californians as a potential brown recluse. There are hundreds of species of these spiders in California. They include ground spiders (Gnaphosidae), sac spiders (Cheiracanthium spp., Trachelas spp.), wolf spiders (Lycosidae), grass spiders (Agelenidae), orb weavers (Araneidae), and male crevice spiders (Filistatidae). Additionally, males of both the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the false black widow, Steatoda grossa, are frequently brought in as suspected recluse spiders. All of these brown spiders have 8 eyes and thus can be quickly eliminated from consideration. AMERICAN RECLUSE SPIDERS Eleven species of recluse spiders are native to the United States and two non-natives have become established in certain highly-limited areas of the country. The brown recluse spider is the proper common name for only one species, Loxosceles reclusa . It is the most widespread of the North American recluse spiders and lives in the south central Midwest from southeastern Nebraska to southwestern Ohio and south through Texas to north Georgia. In addition to these native species, the Chilean recluse spider, Loxosceles laeta (pronounced \"LEE-ta\"), has become established in portions of Los Angeles (Alhambra, Sierra Madre, Monterey Park, and San Gabriel). This spider, however, seems to be confined to a very limited area in Los Angeles County, has been present there for at least 80 years (one specimen was collected from Los Angeles in 1936) and is not spreading. Also, occasional interceptions of the Mediterranean recluse, Loxosceles rufescens are found in commercial goods shipped from out-of-state or from international cargo, but no populations of this spider are currently known in California and finds of them are still incredibly rare. Recluse spiders, as their name implies, are reclusive. They build webs as trigger systems to indicate that potential prey are walking nearby. They also use silk to build retreats in which to hide during the day. These nocturnal spiders emerge from their retreats at night and actively hunt down prey or may wait for prey to land in the small area several inches from their retreat. As dawn approaches, they may seek shelter in dark places such as in clothing or shoes, and mature males roam in search of females. It is these two behaviors that can bring them into contact with people. In nature, recluses are found in cracks and crevices in and under rocks or the loose bark of dead trees. Recluses have very much benefited from human-altered environments, where they are readily found under trash cans, plywood, tarps, rubber tires, and in storage boxes. They are synanthropic (found in association with humans) and therefore are considered \"house\" spiders. In fact in South America, the recluse species have common names that translate as \"the spider behind the picture\" or \"the spider in the corner.\" Recluse spiders are relatively long lived. Among the various species, they mature after about 1 year and average a 2- to 4-year life span with some living more than 7 years under laboratory conditions. They are also well known for surviving long periods (6 to 12 months) without food before perishing. Abundance of Recluses One consistent life history characteristic of recluse spiders is that in the right environment their populations are usually dense. If you find recluses, you do not find one, you find many. The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is a common house spider in the midwestern United States. Examples of the densities that the brown recluse can attain around human habitation include 9 under a piece of plywood in Oklahoma, 52 in an indoor laboratory, 6 under a waterbed frame in Arkansas, 40 collected in a Missouri barn in one hour, and 44 caught in sticky traps in a Tennessee home in one day. Eight Oklahoma 13-year-olds unknowingly hand-collected about 60 amongst bricks in about 7 minutes without getting bitten. In a 6-month study, a family in Kansas collected 2,055 brown recluse spiders in their 19th-century built home. They lived there nearly a decade, continued to find brown recluse spiders regularly, and only once in 10 years had anyone shown evidence of a bite; it was to a finger which turned red for a few days and then healed without incident. In fact, on many evenings, this family collected more brown recluse spiders per hour in their home than the entire California human population has ever been able to find in the state. Similarly, for the desert recluse in California, 12 of these spiders were collected under a doghouse in Yucca Valley and 6 were removed in one night from a small cottage bedroom in a Mojave Desert research facility. Absence of Brown Recluses in California Unlike many other spiders that disperse by either migrating or being carried by air currents when small (\"ballooning\"), recluse spiders usually only expand outside their native range as a result of human intervention. The few brown recluses that have been collected in California typically are found in facilities that receive goods from out of state or are unintentionally transported by people who have moved from the Midwest. In these instances, searching the immediate area yielded no additional brown recluses so they were considered to be individual stowaways. Undoubtedly, more brown recluses have been inadvertently brought into the state via commerce and the relocation of household belongings, especially during the Dust Bowl era, however amazingly few specimens have ever been collected. Translocated recluse spiders have never been able to establish a foothold and start a population in California. Considering that brown recluse spider bites are not common in the south-central Midwest where brown recluses frequently cohabit with people, it is clear that California does not have anywhere near sufficient populations of these spiders to be responsible for the number of bites that are attributed to them. RICE Therapy: The recommended treatment for most brown recluse bites (the ones that do not develop severe symptoms) is simple first aid: RICE therapy. R est I ce C ompression E levation',\n",
       "       'damage': 'All Loxosceles spiders tested so far have the venom component that is capable of causing necrotic skin lesions, so it is best to assume that all recluse spiders may be capable of causing skin damage. In general, the desert recluse spider\\'s venom is similar to that of the brown recluse and should be considered of equal potency. In comparison to the brown recluse spider, the Chilean recluse supposedly has more potent venom and the Mediterranean recluse\\'s venom has been said to be less potent. However, these comparisons are more anecdotal than quantitive assessments. About 10% of brown recluse bites cause moderate or greater tissue damage and scarring, but the vast majority only result in inflammation and heal well without medical intervention. Deaths have been reported in children, however these are extremely rare occurrences and can be prevented if accurately diagnosed and the proper medical treatment applied. Medical Misdiagnoses The problem of misdiagnosis is widespread in North America, including such unlikely places as Alaska and Canada where doctors have attributed skin lesions to recluse bites when no brown recluse spiders have ever been found north of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. One reason for the great awareness of the recluse spiders throughout North America is that necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds are commonly misdiagnosed as \"brown recluse bites.\" Although recluses can cause these types of wounds, the biological data involving the distribution of the spider indicate that most of these diagnoses are incorrect. A world-renowned toxicology physician who worked at University of Southern California Medical Center estimates that most general spider bites in California referred to him were actually the work of other arthropods, and that 60% of \"brown recluse spider bite\" diagnoses came from areas where no Loxosceles spiders were known to exist. This is a serious problem, in that several medical conditions misdiagnosed as recluse bites can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal consequences. Additionally, many people diagnosed as having brown recluse bites in California are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics work against bacteria and have no effect on spider venom. However, regardless of the causative agent, it is wise to seek medical attention if you feel that it is warranted. Because most brown recluse bites involve only inflammation, the recommended treatment is simple first aid: RICE therapy (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) although other medical experts suggest cold instead of ice (to avoid freezing tissue) and a neutral position (lay flat) rather than elevated. Multiple Lesions Spiders typically bite only once as a desperate defensive effort before they are crushed between flesh and some object. Therefore, spider bites are not the causes of skin lesions if 1) there are multiple lesions on one person at the same time, especially if the lesions are on widely separated parts of the body, 2) if there are multiple episodes of lesions on the same person over a period of several weeks or months, or 3) if there are multiple people in the same house or facility showing skin lesions at the same time. Multiple lesions immediately point toward the more likely situation of a contagious bacterial infection like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or possibly an infestation of an arthropod (fleas, mites, kissing bugs, bed bugs, etc.) that seeks out mammals for blood meals. Bacterial Infections Group A Streptococcus infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis, is sometimes misdiagnosed as a brown recluse bite, and has a fatality rate that can vary from 20 to 80% depending on how quickly it is correctly diagnosed. In serious cases, death from Strepococcus A can occur in a few days. Another medical condition that is frequently misdiagnosed as a spider bite or brown recluse bite is MRSA bacterial infection. Infections of this pathogen, which began to emerge in the 1990s, are no worse than other Staph infections. However, because they are not remedied by common antibiotics, the infections continue out of control and can be fatal unless properly medicated. In one national study involving 11 university-based medical facilities, 29% of the patients presenting for \"spider bite\" had MRSA as the cause of their skin and soft tissue injury. MRSA is a contagious infection, frequently found in places where people are housed in close quarters for lengthy periods of time. Such conditions include prisons and other correctional facilities, nursing homes, long-term health care facilities, sports camps, military barracks, and locker rooms and typically involve several people being afflicted simultaneously. Very often \"spider bites\" are the first thing that people blame as the cause of these wounds. However, more careful investigation typically leads to identifying a MRSA bacterial infection as the causal agent.The problem clears up quickly when the bacterial infection is correctly diagnosed and treated. Necrotic Wound Causes If you do get a necrotic wound in California, you and your medical professional should consider many other common causes to be much more probable than a bite from a brown recluse spider. If an arthropod is involved at all, one should first consider all those creatures that seek out mammals for blood meals and may cause necrotic-type wounds. These include mites, fleas, bed bugs, mosquitoes, soft ticks, hard ticks, and blood-sucking conenose bugs (also known as kissing bugs) (see Pest Notes : Fleas, Bed Bugs, Mosquitoes, Conenose Bugs, and Lyme Disease in California listed in SUGGESTED READING). In addition, there is a long list of medical conditions and diseases that exhibit necrotic-type wounds. A few of these are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial infections, lymphomatoid papulosis (a non-Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphoma), diabetic ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, infected herpes simplex, herpes zoster (\"shingles\"), chemical and thermal burns, poison ivy, poison oak, and Lyme disease. Any and all of these situations are more likely than the bite of a brown recluse spider in California.',\n",
       "       'management': 'If you do not live in the shaded areas on the map, you do not need to be concerned with recluse spiders in California. If you do live within the range of these spiders, you still need to verify that you have recluses on your property before attempting control. Not all micro-habitats within the shaded areas will be suitable for recluse survival. For example, even though Loxosceles laeta occurs in densely populated sections of Los Angeles, this species is usually found only in dark commercial and municipal storage basements, not in homes. This leaves the desert recluse as the only California species of concern, and a minor one at that. After verifying that you do have desert recluses in your home, there are steps you can take to reduce encounters with them. These measures are similar for reducing encounters with spiders in general. Nonchemical control The most important precaution is to remove or reduce outdoor trash and rubbish, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cansespecially if they are stored right next to the house. In residences with attached garages, block off house access to spiders by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites in self defense. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any bed skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under the bed. This minimizes the chance that any spider can crawl onto the bed and inflict a bite. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally used (gardening clothes and gloves, boots, baseball mitts, seasonal clothes and gear, etc.) should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags or bins, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Sticky traps placed along floor boards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. See the short UC IPM YouTube video How to Catch a Spider. Chemical control Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy and much less toxic for your living area to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify. Freeze the spider first, soak it in rubbing alcohol for a few days to preserve it, then pour off the alcohol and rinse the spider with water to remove alcohol residue before shipping. When sending the spider in for identification, do not mail it in alcohol as this is a violation of postal regulations.'},\n",

Most spiders observed in the open during the day are not likely to bite you or cause lasting harm if they do bite you. Spiders whose bites might require you to seek medical attention spend most of their time hidden. Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have 8 legs and 2 body partsan abdomen and a combined head and thorax. They lack wings and antennae. Spider families vary by body shape, web type, hunting or other behavior, and the arrangement and relative size of their eyes. Cellar spiders have long, skinny legs and hang upside down in dark corners, often indoors, sometimes bouncing when disturbed. The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, is shown here. Cobweb spiders hang upside down in sticky, irregularly spun webs waiting for prey. Most cobweb species are small and harmless, such as this Theridion dilutum. Western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most well-known cobweb spider. Most black widow bites come from mature adult females (left), which can usually be recognized by a red hourglass on the underside of the abdomen. The adult male (right) is lighter-colored and smaller than the female. Crab or flower spiders, such as Misumena vatia, have enlarged front legs. They hunt during the day without webs. Dwarf spiders are tiny, hunt during the day, and produce sheetlike or irregular crisscross webs on surfaces. Funnel weavers spin thick, flattened webs and sit at the center of a silken hole, or funnel, running out to capture prey that contact the web. Often seen are Hololena nedra (left) and the common house spider, Tegenaria species, (right) found in gardens and on walls and ceilings inside the house. Lynx spiders are active hunters that stalk and capture prey. Legs are spiny, and the abdomen is narrowest at the rear. They dont spin webs. Shown here is a green lynx spider, Peucetia viridans . Jumping spiders hunt during the day, stalking and pouncing on prey. They are hairy, sometimes iridescent, and dont spin webs. This Phidippus species is eating a house fly. Orb weaver or garden spiders, such as this western spotted orb weaver, Neoscona oaxacensis, (left) often are large and colorful and wait in their webs or nearby for prey to become entangled. They spin elaborate webs in concentric circles in the garden. Sac spiders hide in silk tubes in places such as corners, beneath plants, or on bark, and stalk prey at night. They occur indoors and out and usually are pale, such as this agrarian sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum. Wolf spiders have long, hairy legs and are often found running along the ground. They dont build webs to capture prey but can have a silken retreat. Females carry young on their backs.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'There are two species of widow spiders in California, the western black widow and the brown widow. Both are in the genus Latrodectus and are characterized by a similar body shape, reclusive habit, and irregular cobwebs. The western black widow, a native species, is widespread, and is the spider posing the greatest potential envenomation threat to humans in the western United States. It is well known in many localities, and nonprofessionals can identify it easily. In the first decade of the 21st century, the non-native brown widow became established in southern California. Although it isn\\'t nearly as dangerous as the black widow, it causes alarm because of the reputation of its relative. BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS Several species of black widow are common in North America, but in the western United States the only species present is the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus. Its habitat ranges from British Columbia and Alberta to Mexico and throughout the Rocky Mountains to the western portions of the Great Plains. In California, it is a common desert spider that can survive very hot, dry conditions. However, black widows also can be found in mountainous terrain above 5,000-foot elevation in Southern California, where snow covers the ground every winter. Outside California, western black widows are common in urban Colorado, in central and eastern Washington state, and in southern British Columbia. Because the holes, cracks, crevices, trash, and clutter associated with human structures provide ideal habitat for the western black widow, these spiders are often very common around homes, barns, outbuildings, and rock walls. In such supportive habitats, mature females can be found every few feet and sometimes within inches of each other. Identification A mature female western black widow spider is about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in body length, and has a rounded abdomen and very characteristic coloration. She is shiny jet black all over her body and legs, except for a red pattern on the underside of the abdomen, which looks, in perfect specimens, like an hourglass. Some specimens have a brownish or plum-colored tinge, but usually these are females that are so well fed that the black-pigmented abdomen has been stretched until it looks brown instead of black. The red hourglass varies in appearance; it can be two perfect triangles with points merged to make a perfect hourglass, two triangles separated by a space, a triangle and a small bar, minimal or almost imperceptible red coloration, or, on rare occasions, completely absent. The false black widow, which is discussed below, is chocolate brown and never has red coloration, although many people frequently mistake it for a black widow. As easy as it is to identify an adult female black widow, the immatures, looking nothing like the mother, can be difficult to recognize. When black widow spiderlings emerge from their egg sac, they have tan legs and a tan cephalothorax (the body part to which the legs attach), while the abdomen is mostly white with a few black spots. As the spider grows, the background coloration of the abdomen becomes olive-gray or tan; and there is a longitudinal white stripe on the top of the abdomen and diagonal stripes on the flanks, with a small black dot at the uppermost portion of each diagonal stripe. As the spiderlings continue to grow larger, they molt, like all spiders, in order to shed their restrictive exoskeletons. With successive molts in females, the white stripes become thinner, the olive-gray or tan coloration darkens toward black, and eventually the spider acquires its well-known black coloration. Some mature females retain one or two conspicuous, indented white lines on the front surface of the abdomen that look like a corporal\\'s chevrons. In the youngest spiders, the space where the hourglass develops starts off being a whitish shield. As the spider grows and molts several times, the color of this shield turns from white-yellow to orange-red and changes from a shield with a thick middle portion to an hourglass with a thin, tapered middle. In contrast to the female, the male black widow retains the coloration of the juvenile. After it matures, it stops eating and its abdomen shrinks (its only task at this point is to mate). The male still retains one longitudinal abdominal stripe and a set of diagonal flank stripes on each side of the abdomen. The males are much smaller than the females in body length, although sometimes their legs are almost as long as those of the adult female. Egg Sac The egg sac of the western black widow is yellowish and teardrop-shaped, tapered at the top and bulbous at the bottom. The margins of the sac are well defined (as opposed to some spider egg sacs, which look like fluffy cotton balls, making it difficult to determine exactly where the egg sac starts). The egg sac covering is very tough and difficult to rip apart. A female western black widow typically lays about 300 eggs per sac. Because females can store sperm from their only mating, they can produce more than 10 egg sacs without subsequent matings and without a decrease in the number of eggs or a reduction in the percentage of eggs that will successfully hatch into spiderlings. Habitat The western black widow is found in populated areas almost everywhere in California. Although they can be found in homes, black widows typically nest outside, around the home in holes and crevices, and within clutter. In garages, they usually make webs by doors, near vents, and in other places where insects may pass by. Because most people don\\'t tolerate large numbers of insects in their living spaces, widow spiders usually won\\'t find sufficient prey to survive inside homes. Black widows are shy spiders that seek retreats, such as holes between bricks or spaces around pipe penetrations in walls, where they can hide during the day and then come out at night. In natural settings, you can often find them in rodent burrows and crevices in rock faces. The spider makes a web of tangled silk extending from this retreat hole. The web doesn\\'t have a very recognizable pattern, although it does have vertical support threads above and below the central areas where the spider sits while it waits for prey at night. The lower support threads also alert the widow to the presence of a prey item blundering into the web. In most cases, a widow spider will seek a retreat near the ground as the home base for her web, which connects to the retreat, allowing the spider to emerge to catch both flying and crawling prey at night, usually within three feet of the ground. However, some spiders will make a retreat well above ground level, such as in the eave of a house, and then drop down 10 or more feet before building their web. Widow spiders come out at dusk. After making improvements to their existing web, they take up a position in the middle, their underside facing upward, to wait for prey. Any large disturbance of the web that indicates something larger than a prey item causes the spider to quickly move toward the safety of its retreat. The silk of a mature black widow is very strong. If you run your finger through the web of a large spider, the result is an audible ripping sound. Black widow silk is so strong that during World War II, it was used to make crosshairs for gun sights. Medical Aspects Bites from black widow spiders are quite rare, even where these spiders are very common. In the unlikely event of an actual bite from a black widow, the bite itself is painless or may feel like a little pinprick. Almost all medically important black widow bites are from the adult female, which is much larger than the male. The female also has stronger biting muscles and a larger venom reserve. At the site of the bite, there may be a little red mark or red streaking away from the bite. Within an hour, other symptoms may start to appear. Bite victims might suffer from some but not all of the following symptoms: Rigid stomach muscles, which some medical professionals have misdiagnosed as appendicitis Sweating, sometimes of just the bitten body part, such as a bite to the hand that results in only the arm sweating profusely Pain that can be local, radiating, or regional Urine retention Numbness, agitation, fever, and patchy paralysis (less common) Another sign of envenomation is that bite victims will sometimes move or rock back and forth incessantly to try to lessen the pain from the venom injection process. Although these are the most severe manifestations of black widow bites, symptoms most often merely resemble those of the flu. Black widow bites don\\'t cause conspicuous swelling, necrosis, or deterioration of tissue around the bite. As a neurotoxin, the venom of a black widow affects the nerve-muscle junction in the body. Normally, the body\\'s neurons work like a light switch: they make the muscle turn on and then off again so that the muscle can relax and be ready to contract again if needed. The venom causes the muscle to repeatedly contract. It would be like flipping on a light switch and not being able to turn it off again. If bitten, seek medical attention immediately. You can place a cold pack on the bite to relieve the pain. An antivenom for black widow bites is available that works for all species that have been tested worldwide. Response is fast, and bite victims can go from intense pain back to normal in 30 minutes. The antivenom is based on horse serum, so physicians need to monitor for anaphylactic shock. American physicians are somewhat reluctant to use antivenom for this reason and might prefer to have the bite victim simply endure the symptoms, which can be similar to those of a bad flu episode and usually dissipate in a few days. BROWN WIDOW SPIDERS The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is found worldwide in subtropical habitats. It probably originated from Africa, or possibly from South America. In North America, the brown widow was found only in Florida for many decades, where it remains rather common. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the spider began appearing elsewhere, from Texas throughout the Gulf Coast states and up the Atlantic coast into South Carolina. While they were expanding in the southeastern United States, brown widows started being discovered in great numbers in Southern California, where they have caused great concern within the general public. Initial news reports exaggerated the impact of the brown widow. However, unlike that of the black widow, the bite of this spider is not much more toxic to humans than that of other common spiders. Identification Mature female brown widows are smaller than mature female western black widows, being about 3/8\" in body length (10 mm). The normal brown widow spider coloration is a mottled collection of tan, brown, and gray. It has a lengthwise stripe halfway up the back side of the abdomen with two isolated dots in front of it and diagonal stripes on the side, somewhat similar to immature western black widow spiders (see Table 1). However, the usual background coloration of the brown widow is more of a tan, as compared to the western black widow, in which background coloration is more olive-gray. Male brown widows are much smaller [body length: 3/16 inch (4 to 5 mm)] than other widow spiders and therefore might be overlooked or misidentified. There is, however, great variation in brown widow coloration. Spiders can vary from almost white to almost black. When brown widows are very dark, though, this coloration is closer to a flat black than a shiny black like that of a mature black widow female. A mature brown widow female looks very similar to an immature western black widow, thus some skill is needed to identify the two accurately. However, the brown widow egg sac, as described in the next paragraph, is distinctive and a much surer way to confirm the species. Table 1. Features used to distinguish brown widows from immature western black widows. Feature Brown widow Black widow (immature) Black spots on lateral abdominal stripes large, squarish small, elliptical Hourglass bottom half larger top half larger rough margins crisp, straight margins White markings on front of abdomen not continuous continuous Egg Sac The egg sac of the brown widow spider has protuberances of silk all over its surface, resembling a very large pollen grain. The sac is so characteristic that it can be used to verify the presence of brown widows even if the spiders themselves are not seen. Brown widows produce about 130 eggs per egg sac and are able to make 20 or more egg sacs in a lifetime, sometimes multiple sacs within a short time period. Female brown widows can be collected with several simultaneously-developing egg sacs. Habitat The habitat of the brown widow is similar in many respects to that of the black widow. They generally reside in cluttered areas outside, such as woodpiles, but you will also find them in more exposed areas, such as on chain-link fences where black widows normally would not be found. They are also extremely common in the nooks and crannies on the undersides of inexpensive plastic patio furniture. Brown widow spiders make irregular webs of strong silk, similar to those of western black widows. Both black widows and brown widows are almost never found in homes. In garages, black widows are common but brown widows are not. Outside and around the home, both spiders are very common. The brown widow appears to be displacing the black widow in some of its habitats, especially in urban areas. Southern California residents frequently mention that they used to have a few black widows, but now only can find brown widows (and in greater numbers). In a study published in 2012, brown widows outnumbered black widows in urban areas; such as around homes, in parks (especially under playground equipment), in zoos, etc. The same study, however, reported that brown widows were not found in natural areas in southern California (such as in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat) and were rare around agricultural buildings. Brown widows were occasionally found in agricultural crops such as citrus, apple, and avocado trees as well as in corn stalks, bird-of-paradise leaves and other plants, but most of these finds were in vegetation associated with small home gardens rather than large commercial properties. As of 2016, brown widows were well established from Santa Barbara to the San Bernardino area and south to Mexico. Established populations have not yet been found north of the Los Angeles Basin, in the Central Valley, or in the desert areas (which may be inhospitable for them due to the arid climate). Although unsubstantiated reports of brown widows occurring north of the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara region (such as in the San Francisco Bay area) have been made for years, submitted spiders have been immature black widows, Steatoda (false black widow) spiders of several species, or orbweavers. However, it is possible that the brown widow is continuing to expand its range in California. Medical Aspects The bite of the brown widow is much milder than that of the western black widow. In a study in Africa, the most common symptoms in 15 verified bites were that the bite hurt when it happened and that there was burning pain at the bite site. None of these patients developed the typical dynamic symptoms of black widow envenomation. Despite these observations, there is one American record of a verified bite where the patient developed more severe symptoms and required hospitalization. Although its venom is at least as potent as black widow venom (drop for drop, as tested in mice), the brown widow is smaller and likely injects much less venom during a bite. In addition, bites to people are unlikely since brown widows, when disturbed, typically pull their legs close to the body, drop from their web, and play dead. The recent arrival of the brown widow in Southern California is not a cause for alarm. In fact, if the brown widow is indeed displacing the more toxic black widow, there actually might be a reduction in spider bite risk as compared to previous decades. OTHER RELATED SPIDERS False Black Widow The false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, is not a true widow spider; however, it is in the same family, Theridiidae, as widow spiders and can easily be confused with them. It shares the same rounded-abdomen body form and web-making traits. It is slightly smaller than a mature western black widow spider [body length: 3/8 inch (10 mm)], chocolate brown in color, and never has red coloration on its belly. The false black widow is a European immigrant that has become extremely common in Pacific Coast homes from San Diego to British Columbia, with isolated finds in Alaska. Unlike black widows, false black widow spiders thrive indoors, especially in washrooms, inside cupboards and underneath appliances, furniture and cabinets. False black widows make an egg sac that looks like a cotton ball with indistinct margins. Unlike black widow spiders, false black widow spiderlings are dark like their mothers when they emerge. Because they are common in homes, false black widows are more frequently involved in bite incidents than black widow or brown widow spiders. They have mild venom, and bites may cause symptoms similar to those of yellowjacket wasp stings: initial burning pain followed by minor localized swelling around the envenomation site. When black widow antivenom mistakenly has been used on false black widow bites, it appeared to eliminate the venom\\'s effects. Noble False Widow Spider In 2011, Steatoda nobilis was discovered in Southern California. Like the false black widow, this spider is a European native. Mature females can reach 5/8 inch (14 mm) in body length, which is significantly larger than the false black widow. Instead of being uniformly colored on the top surface of the abdomen as is the false black widow, Steatoda nobilis usually has a light tan pattern somewhat resembling a house with two windows and a domed roof. However, in some specimens, only the remnant tip of the \"roof\" is exhibited. There is also a broad, tan band on the front-facing surface of the abdomen. This spider was first found in Ventura County. It is now widespread in coastal San Diego County, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay area. Isolated finds have occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Bites from this species are not considered to be medically significant. There have been two recorded bites from the spider, with minor symptom development, but because of its large size, it has the potential to hurt merely from fang penetration. This spider will probably continue to spread throughout coastal California.',\n",

       "       'management': \"Minimizing sites around the home where spiders may hide, such as clutter, woodpiles, and heavy ground cover, is essential for reducing widow spider populations. However, it is not practical to eliminate these spiders completely. Both widow species will continue to re-infest treated areas. Regularly vacuuming or sweeping windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, and other seldom-used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually don't survive this process. In the garage, keep items such as gardening clothes and gloves in bags closed with zipper-locks or twist ties. Store seasonal items such as sports gear, camping gear, winter clothes or holiday decorations in boxes that can be taped shut and placed off the floor away from walls in order to exclude spiders. When cleaning up clutter in garages and other storage areas, be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Other areas to check carefully include children's toys or playhouses made of molded plastic that have open spaces facing downward where spiders can crawl in. Additional favored habitats of widow spiders include picnic tables, trash can grips, lawn chairs, plant pots with curled lips, and other outdoor objects with sheltered lips or crevices. Be careful that you do not carry spiders indoors on items such as plants, firewood, and boxes. Stack woodpiles away from your house, and never pick up pieces of wood unless you are wearing gloves. Eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping areas near building foundations free of trash, leaf litter, and accumulations of other materials. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attract spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures pointed off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides do not provide long-term control. Because widow spiders are nocturnal, a nonchemical method of eradication is to search for them at night with a flashlight and kill them with a shoe or rolled up newspaper. If you are concerned about wildlife and feel comfortable doing so, you can remove individual spiders from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper underneath to seal off the opening when you lift the jar. Release the spider about 100 feet from your home into a natural area. Brown widows may not survive in natural areas but on the other hand, they are an invasive, non-native pest species and should not be there anyway. One aspect that makes controlling widow spiders difficult is that they, like many spiders, exhibit a behavior called ballooning. When the spiderlings are very small, on warm days when there is an updraft, they climb to the top of a fence post or piece of vegetation, raise their abdomens into the air, and release a small filament of silk. When the updraft currents overtake the forces of gravity, the spiderling is carried into the air to another location. This may only be a few feet away, or it could be miles. Ballooning spiderlings have been captured at 10,000 feet from the ground and 200 miles offshore. Because spiderlings will be dropping down on your property continually, eliminating them will be a task that needs to be done repeatedly throughout the year. Chemical Control Typically, control of spiders using pesticides is difficult. Various insecticides are registered for control of spiders; including pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and combinations of these products. Curiously, most of these registered pesticides are water-based while the silk of spider egg sacs repels water. In a 2016 study, water-based insecticides sprayed on brown widow egg sacs provided no significant effect on the egg contents. However, when petroleum-based products were used, the pesticide was readily carried past the silk outer layer and killed the egg sac contents.\"},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Spiders are mostly beneficial because they feed on pest insects. However, many people think that all spiders are dangerous and aggressive. In California, the main spider capable of causing serious injury is the black widow, which generally remains outdoors and out of sight. Spiders seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people. Focus pest management efforts on removing webs and hiding places. Pesticides are not generally recommended. What to know about spiders: The jaws of most spiders are too small to bite humans. Adult female black widows are the main spiders capable of seriously injuring people in California. They are shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the underside and are commonly found outdoors, in sheltered, dry, undisturbed areas such as wood piles and garages. Anyone bitten by a black widow spider should remain calm and seek medical advice. The brown recluse spider and the hobo spider do not live in California. Some other spiders bite when trapped in clothing or bedding, but the effect is usually no more severe than itching or the reaction to a bee sting. To prevent spiders from entering your house, take these steps: Seal home foundation cracks and other access holes. Inspect window and door screens for good seals to keep out spiders and the insects they prey on. Keep areas around home foundations free of clutter. Manage spiders using these tips: Indoors, regular housecleaning provides adequate spider control. Vacuum up the spider and its web. Alternatively, squash spiders or capture them in a jar and release them outside. Prevent clutter buildup that can provide spider hiding places both indoors and out. Remove spider webs from the exterior of the house with a broom or high pressure hose. Spiders and biological control: When removing spiders, dont overlook the fact that spiders eat a large number and variety of nuisance and pest insects. Spiders also have natural enemieswasps, other spiders, birds, reptiles, and othersthat sometimes keep them from becoming too numerous.',\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'The names wood wasp and horntail describe several kinds of wood-boring insects in the order Hymenoptera, family Siricidae. Of greatest concern are the large, nonstinging wasps that normally are attracted to and complete their life cycles in newly dead or dying conifer trees. Timber salvaged from these trees can be processed into infested lumber. This can lead to adult wasps emerging in recently completed buildings or structures. Although these insects are extremely annoying, they arent harmful to humans or structures. They attack only trees and wont bore into wood in buildings or furniture. See the Pest Note: Wood-boring Beetles in the Home for information on borers that will attack furniture or structures. The dozen species of wood wasps in California, Oregon, and Washington look similar. They are large insects, generally 1 inch or longer, and wasplike in appearance but have an elongated, cylindrical body without a noticeable constriction or waist. They often are black or metallic dark blue or combinations of black, red, and yellow. They make a noisy buzz when flying. The male and female have a similar body shape, except the female is larger and has a long egg-laying apparatus (ovipositor) that can exceed her body length. The female can use her ovipositor only for egg laying; she cant use it to sting in defense. Although these pests can chew through wood, they dont bite people.',\n",
       "       'identification': '',\n",
       "       'development': 'A female wood wasp drills her ovipositor nearly 3/4 inch into the wood of a weakened or dying tree and lays 1 to 7 eggs. At the same time, she squirts in a fungus from her abdominal gland. She continues this process, laying up to 200 eggs. Eggs hatch in 3 to 4 weeks, and larvae tunnel into the fungus-predigested wood parallel with the grain. Larvae are legless, cylindrical, whitish, and have a spine at the tip of their last abdominal segment. As they chew, larvae use a spine at the tip of their abdomen to help push themselves forward, through the wood. Larvae begin eating the softer wood (sapwood) just beneath the bark, following the fungus into the heartwood, then return to the sapwood to complete their feeding. Larval feeding continues through 5 or more immature stages, which take at least a year and as many as 5 years in cooler climates to complete. The tunnel, or gallery, usually measures 10 to 12 inches long at completion. Pupation takes place at the end of the gallery. After 5 or 6 weeks as a pupa, the adult emerges by chewing through about 3/4 inch of wood, leaving a round exit hole 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter.',\n",
       "       'damage': 'Wood wasp damage in buildings is more cosmetic than structurally weakening. The total number of insects emerging in any one house is limited, usually fewer than a dozen. Emerging wood wasps can chew through just about any substance, and you can see their large exit holes in wallboard or plaster walls, hardwood floors, linoleum, carpeting, nonceramic floor tiles, and other interior surfaces. Wood wasps dont reinfest structures. Even if male and female wood wasps had the opportunity to mate in the building, the females would not be stimulated to lay eggs in dry, finished lumber.',\n",
       "       'management': 'Wood wasps are likely to occur anywhere infested timber is used for construction. Even though salvaged timber is adequate for restricted, lower-grade construction purposes such as studs and subflooring, it isnt valuable enough to warrant kiln drying. Kiln drying or vacuum fumigation of lumber is the only effective way to kill wood wasp larvae that have survived milling operations, but treatment is costly. Fumigation of milled lumber in boxcars, under tarpaulins, and in standing buildings hasnt been successful. Even though wood wasps can be a noisy, and sometimes scary, nuisance, they arent a threat to anyone or anything. Waiting out the life cycle and repairing cosmetic damage is about all that can be done in an infested building.'},\n",

       "      'body': {'description': 'Adelgids (family Adelgidae) are aphidlike insects that suck plant juices from conifers. At least eight species occur in California. Hosts include Douglas-fir, fir, hemlock, larch, pine, and spruce. Adelgids commonly occur beneath cottony white or grayish wax they secrete or inside of galled plant tissue. The adelgids themselves are small, dark, soft-bodied, oval insects. The insects can look different depending on the host, and several different-looking stages of the same species can occur together. Balsam woolly adelgid. Adelges piceae has seriously damaged or killed tens of thousands of true fir trees in the eastern United States. Inadvertently introduced from Europe, it more recently has become established in Oregon and northwestern California. This adelgid occurs only on Abies species and does not alternate hosts in the United States. The round, dark purple to black adelgids are 125 inch long or less. They occur under cottony wax on fir twigs and trunk bark. When infested, shoots become stunted and develop globular galled wood (gouting) around buds and branch nodes. Infested shoots and limbs die back and the firs gradually decline and commonly die. If you find an adelgid-infested dying fir or suspected balsam woolly adelgids, report the location to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner. For more information see Balsam Woolly Adelgid from Utah State University. Cooley spruce gall adelgid. Adelges cooleyi feeds on spruce and Douglas-fir and some populations alternate generations between these hosts. Nymphs produce a white, cottony tuft where each individual settles and feeds on cones, needles, and shoots. High populations cause needles to become distorted, spotted, and drop prematurely. Cooley spruce gall adelgid feeding can cause spruce terminals to distort into a gall that eventually encloses a group of the insects. The galls are 1/2 to 3 inches long and light green to purple. About midsummer, the nymphs emerge from galls and molt into winged adults. The empty galls harden, turn brown, and die and may persist for years. Cooley spruce gall adelgid produces galls on spruce only when Douglas-fir is nearby because this alternate host is the source of the adelgids gall-forming stage. Galls in California are mostly seen along the North Coast and in mountainous areas where Douglas-fir is common. For more information and an illustration of its host-alternating life cycle, see Cooley Spruce Galls from Colorado State University. Pine bark adelgids. The pine bark adelgid (Pineus strobi), also called the pine bark aphid, and the pine leaf adelgid (Pineus pinifoliae) produce abundant pale wax where they feed on pine bark and twigs. Some populations migrate between pine and spruce. On spruce twigs infested by Pineus species galls form and are typically smaller and less prominent than the galls of Cooley spruce gall adelgid. Adult female Pineus species are dark blue to purplish black, soft-bodied insects that lay yellowish pink eggs in cottony, wax-covered masses. The mobile first instars (crawlers) that emerge resemble tiny pepper grains on the cottony egg masses. Settled nymphs (immatures) are brown, dark blue, or greenish and occur under wax. Adelgids develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Most adelgids have several generations per year and a complex life history that can include several types of adults with differing appearance. Their biology can include generations alternating between two different conifer species. Adelgids suck and feed on conifers and inject saliva that can cause host tissue to distort. Adelges and Pineus species cause white cottony tufts on the bark, branches, cones, needles, or twigs. Heavily infested trees may seem covered with snow. Cone-shaped galls or swollen twigs may develop on infested fir and spruce. High adelgid populations cause foliage yellowing, early drop of needles, and drooping and dieback of terminals. Prolonged high populations can retard plant growth. Vigorous plants tolerate moderate populations and most adelgid species are unlikely to seriously harm trees. Exceptions are balsam woolly adelgid introduced in Northern California and hemlock woolly adelgid in the eastern United States. Be alert for these serious pests and any unusually damaging adelgid problems on hemlock, true fir, or spruce. If suspected balsam woolly adelgids or hemlock woolly adelgids are found where not known to occur report the location the local office of the county agricultural commissioner. Usually no control is needed to protect the health of established trees. An exception is the balsam woolly adelgid. See the balsam woolly adelgid section in Managing Insects and Diseases of Oregon Conifers (PDF) from Oregon State University for strategies to control this pest. Predators of adelgids are especially important in natural forests, where most adelgids are uncommon. Adelgid predators include brown lacewings, green lacewings, the small maggotlike larvae of aphid flies and predaceous midges, and adults and larvae of several species of small lady beetles. Replace some spruce with other species to reduce adelgid populations that alternate hosts. A forceful stream of water directed at the cottony masses on conifers, especially on trunks, dislodges and kills many adelgids. On spruce, to restore the plants aesthetic quality and provide some control, break off or clip and dispose of infested foliage when the galls are green and before the insects have emerged. Avoid excess fertilization and quick-release fertilizers, which can promote adelgid abundance. High adelgid populations, especially on young trees, can be controlled by applying horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap (potassium salts of fatty acids), or certain other insecticides in the spring when crawlers are abundant. Be aware that oil spray may remove the desirable bluish color from foliage of certain conifers (e.g., blue spruce), but this does not affect tree health. Avoid residual, broad-spectrum insecticides (e.g., carbaryl and pyrethroids), which can cause an increase in spider mite populations unless a miticide is added. Insecticide sprays are more effective when a wetting agent is added and applications are made with high-pressure equipment so that the spray penetrates the insects waxy secretions. Certain systemic insecticides (e.g., imidacloprid) can be effective. Insecticide sprays are not effective in preventing galls unless application is correctly timed based on careful and frequent monitoring. Examine the base of terminal buds on spruce and locate the overwintering females. Inspect females regularly during late winter and spring to determine when they begin to increase greatly in size and start to produce waxy strands; at this time thorough spraying with insecticide can provide control.
